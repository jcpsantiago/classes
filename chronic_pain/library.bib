abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, there are no systematic reviews of epidemiological studies of chronic pain in the developing world.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain worldwide paying particular attention to data from countries with a Human Development Index (HDI) of less than 0.9.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A literature search was conducted for cross-sectional surveys of chronic pain (≥3 months) in the adult general population using Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Sciencedirect, CAS ILLUMINA, Academic search complete, PsycINFO and AMED. Forty-eight studies were identified and 29 of these were excluded because they surveyed children, the elderly or were longitudinal studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Weighted mean ± SD prevalence of chronic pain worldwide was 30.3{\%} ± 11.7{\%} (19 studies, 65 surveys, 34 countries, 182,019 respondents). There was no correlation between HDI and prevalence. In countries with a HDI {\textless} 0.9 prevalence was 33.9{\%} ± 14.5{\%} and significantly higher than prevalence in countries with a HDI of ≥0.9 (29.9{\%} ± 12.7{\%}), although removal of a large study that may have included a sample of individuals with comorbidities reduced the worldwide estimate to 28.0{\%} ± 11.8{\%} (47 surveys, 33 countries, 139,770 participants). Interestingly, the estimate of countries with a HDI {\textless} 0.9 to 24.8{\%} ± 8.9{\%} (7 surveys, 7 countries, 6122 participants) became significantly lower than the estimate of countries with a HDI ≥ 0.9 which was 28.1{\%} ± 11.6{\%} (40 surveys, 21 countries, 133,648 participants).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The review provides further evidence that the prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is high. However, there was insufficient reliable data to estimate with any certainty the prevalence of chronic pain in countries with an HDI {\textless} 0.9 with variability in estimates between surveys being of concern. Subtle differences in review and survey methodology appeared to impact markedly on estimates. There is a need for epidemiological studies that estimate the prevalence of chronic pain in developing countries to determine the scale of the problem.},

abstract = {The minimal model was proposed over 25 years ago. Despite (or because of) its simplicity it continues to be used today - both as a clinical tool and an approach to understanding the composite effects of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity on glucose tolerance and risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The original assumptions of the model have led to an understanding of the kinetics of insulin in vivo, as well as the relative importance of beta-cell compensatory failure in the pathogenesis of diabetes. The disposition index (DI), a parameter emerging from the model, represents the ability of the pancreatic islets to compensate for insulin resistance. There is evidence that a locus on chromosome 11 codes for the DI, which has a significant heritability and can predict type 2 diabetes better than any known genetic locus. Even today, the model continues to be a subject of scientific discovery and discourse.},

abstract = {Measuring insulin sensitivity in the presence of physiological changes in glucose and insulin concentrations, e.g., during a meal or OGTT, is important to better understand insulin resistance in a variety of metabolic conditions. Recently, two oral minimal models have been proposed to measure overall insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and its selective effect on glucose disposal (S(I)*) from oral tests. S(I) and S(I)* have been successfully validated against multiple tracer meal estimates, but validation against euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp estimates is lacking. Here, we do so in 21 subjects who underwent both a multiple-tracer OGTT and a labeled euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Correlation between minimal-model S(I), S(I) and corresponding clamp estimates S(I)(*clamp), S(I)(*clamp) was satisfactory, respectively r = 0.81, P {\textless} 0.001, and r = 0.71, P {\textless} 0.001. S(I) was significantly lower than S(I)(clamp) (8.08 +/- 0.89 vs. 13.66 +/- 1.69 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.0002), whereas S(I) and S(I)(*clamp) were very similar (8.17 +/- 1.59 vs. 8.84 +/- 1.39 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.52). These results add credibility to the oral minimal-model method as a simple and reliable physiological tool to estimate S(I) and S(I)*, also in large-scale clinical trials.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes and is a hallmark of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and many cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, quantifying insulin sensitivity/resistance in humans and animal models is of great importance for epidemiological studies, clinical and basic science investigations, and eventual use in clinical practice. Direct and indirect methods of varying complexity are currently employed for these purposes. Some methods rely on steady-state analysis of glucose and insulin, whereas others rely on dynamic testing. Each of these methods has distinct advantages and limitations. Thus, optimal choice and employment of a specific method depends on the nature of the studies being performed. Established direct methods for measuring insulin sensitivity in vivo are relatively complex. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and the insulin suppression test directly assess insulin-mediated glucose utilization under steady-state conditions that are both labor and time intensive. A slightly less complex indirect method relies on minimal model analysis of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Finally, simple surrogate indexes for insulin sensitivity/resistance are available (e.g., QUICKI, HOMA, 1/insulin, Matusda index) that are derived from blood insulin and glucose concentrations under fasting conditions (steady state) or after an oral glucose load (dynamic). In particular, the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) has been validated extensively against the reference standard glucose clamp method. QUICKI is a simple, robust, accurate, reproducible method that appropriately predicts changes in insulin sensitivity after therapeutic interventions as well as the onset of diabetes. In this Frontiers article, we highlight merits, limitations, and appropriate use of current in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity/resistance.},

abstract = {The simultaneous assessment of insulin action, secretion, and hepatic extraction is key to understanding postprandial glucose metabolism in nondiabetic and diabetic humans. We review the oral minimal method (i.e., models that allow the estimation of insulin sensitivity, $\beta$-cell responsivity, and hepatic insulin extraction from a mixed-meal or an oral glucose tolerance test). Both of these oral tests are more physiologic and simpler to administer than those based on an intravenous test (e.g., a glucose clamp or an intravenous glucose tolerance test). The focus of this review is on indices provided by physiological-based models and their validation against the glucose clamp technique. We discuss first the oral minimal model method rationale, data, and protocols. Then we present the three minimal models and the indices they provide. The disposition index paradigm, a widely used $\beta$-cell function metric, is revisited in the context of individual versus population modeling. Adding a glucose tracer to the oral dose significantly enhances the assessment of insulin action by segregating insulin sensitivity into its glucose disposal and hepatic components. The oral minimal model method, by quantitatively portraying the complex relationships between the major players of glucose metabolism, is able to provide novel insights regarding the regulation of postprandial metabolism.},

abstract = {I. Origin of the Insulin Sensitivity Concept HISTORICALLY, the study of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus was in the traditional pattern of endocrinology: removal of the pancreas led to experimental diabetes, and administration of insulin, a pancreatic isolate, ameliorated the diabetic symptoms (1, 2). These observations led to the widely held belief that human diabetes was primarily a disease of the pancreas, characterized by the inability of the B cell to secrete sufficient insulin to control glycemia. After insulin became available, evidence emerged suggesting that human diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial etiology. Early investigators identified an unexpected variability among diabetics in the ability of injected insulin to ameliorate hyperglycemia (3–5). Larger doses of insulin were required to normalize the blood sugar in patients with the milder nonketotic form of the disease common in the older population, whereas smaller doses were adequate for younger, ketosis-prone diabetics.},

@article{Hahn2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to find a simple intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) that can be used to estimate insulin sensitivity.

METHODS: In 20 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 51 years (mean, 28) comparisons were made between kinetic parameters derived from a 12-sample, 75-min IVGTT and the M(bw) (glucose uptake) obtained during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. Plasma glucose was used to calculate the volume of distribution (V(d)) and the clearance (CL) of the injected glucose bolus. The plasma insulin response was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC(ins)). Uptake of glucose during the clamp was corrected for body weight (M(bw)).

RESULTS: There was a 7-fold variation in M(bw). Algorithms based on the slope of the glucose-elimination curve (CL/V(d)) in combination with AUC(ins) obtained during the IVGTT showed statistically significant correlations with M(bw), the linearity being r(2) = 0.63-0.83. The best algorithms were associated with a 25-75th prediction error ranging from -10{\%} to +10{\%}. Sampling could be shortened to 30-40 min without loss of linearity or precision.

CONCLUSION: Simple measures of glucose and insulin kinetics during an IVGTT can predict between 2/3 and 4/5 of the insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {Many mathematical models have been developed to describe glucose-insulin kinetics as a means of analysing the effective control of diabetes. This paper concentrates on the structural identifiability analysis of certain well-established mathematical models that have been developed to characterise glucose-insulin kinetics under different experimental scenarios. Such analysis is a pre-requisite to experiment design and parameter estimation and is applied for the first time to these models with the specific structures considered. The analysis is applied to a basic (original) form of the Minimal Model (MM) using the Taylor Series approach and a now well-accepted extended form of the MM by application of the Taylor Series approach and a form of the Similarity Transformation approach. Due to the established inappropriate nature of the MM with regard to glucose clamping experiments an alternative model describing the glucose-insulin dynamics during a Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EIC) experiment was considered. Structural identifiability analysis of the EIC model is also performed using the Taylor Series approach and shows that, with glucose infusion as input alone, the model is structurally globally identifiable. Additional analysis demonstrates that the two different model forms are structurally distinguishable for observation of both glucose and insulin.},

abstract = {Orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play key roles in the regulation of wakefulness, feeding, reward, autonomic functions and energy homeostasis. To control these functions indispensable for survival, orexin-expressing neurones integrate peripheral metabolic signals, interact with many types of neurones in the brain and modulate their activities via the activation of orexin-1 receptor or orexin-2 receptor. In addition, a new functional role of orexin is emerging in the regulation of insulin and leptin sensitivities responsible for whole-body glucose metabolism. Recent evidence indicates that orexin efficiently protects against the development of peripheral insulin resistance induced by ageing or high-fat feeding in mice. In particular, the orexin receptor-2 signalling appears to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity and insulin insensitivity by improving leptin sensitivity. In fact, the expression of orexin gene is known to be down-regulated by hyperglycaemia in the rodent model of diabetes, such as ob/ob and db/db mice. Moreover, the levels of orexin receptor-2 mRNA have been shown to decline in the brain of mice along with ageing. These suggest that hyperglycaemia due to insulin insensitivity during ageing or by habitual consumption of a high-fat diet leads to the reduction in orexin expression in the hypothalamus, thereby further exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance. Therefore, orexin receptor controlling hypothalamic insulin/leptin actions may be a new target for possible future treatment of hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {The hypocretins (Hcrts, also known as orexins) are two peptides, both synthesized by a small group of neurons, most of which are in the lateral hypothalamic and perifornical regions of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamic Hcrt system directly and strongly innervates and potently excites noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic neurons. Hcrt also has a major role in modulating the release of glutamate and other amino acid transmitters. Behavioral investigations have revealed that Hcrt is released at high levels in active waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and at minimal levels in non-REM sleep. Hcrt release in waking is increased markedly during periods of increased motor activity relative to levels in quiet, alert waking. Evidence for a role for Hcrt in food intake regulation is inconsistent. I hypothesize that Hcrt's major role is to facilitate motor activity tonically and phasically in association with motivated behaviors and to coordinate this facilitation with the activation of attentional and sensory systems. Degeneration of Hcrt neurons or genetic mutations that prevent the normal synthesis of Hcrt or of its receptors causes human and animal narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is characterized by an impaired ability to maintain alertness for long periods and by sudden losses of muscle tone (cataplexy). Administration of Hcrt can reverse symptoms of narcolepsy in animals, may be effective in treating human narcolepsy, and may affect a broad range of motivated behaviors.},

abstract = {Hypothalamic neurons containing orexin (hypocretin) are activated during motivated behaviors and active waking. We show that injection of orexin-A into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of mice or rats increased glucose uptake and promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, but not in white adipose tissue, by activating the sympathetic nervous system. These effects of orexin were blunted in mice lacking ??-adrenergic receptors but were restored by forced expression of the ??2-adrenergic receptor in both myocytes and nonmyocyte cells of skeletal muscle. Orexin neurons are activated by conditioned sweet tasting and directly excite VMH neurons, thereby increasing muscle glucose metabolism and its insulin sensitivity. Orexin and its receptor in VMH thus play a key role in the regulation of muscle glucose metabolism associated with highly motivated behavior by activating muscle sympathetic nerves and ??2-adrenergic signaling. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Hypocretin (Hcrt) has been implicated in the control of motor activity and in respiration and cardiovascular changes. Loss of Hcrt in narcolepsy is linked to sleepiness and to cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone which is triggered by sudden strong emotions. In the current study we have compared the effects of treadmill running, to yard play on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Hcrt level in normal dogs. We find that treadmill locomotion, at a wide range of speeds, does not increase Hcrt level beyond baseline, whereas yard play produces a substantial increase in Hcrt, even though both activities produce comparable increases in heart rate, respiration and body temperature. We conclude that motor and cardiovascular changes are not sufficient to elevate CSF levels of Hcrt and we hypothesize that the emotional aspects of yard play account for the observed increase in Hcrt.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythm is crucial for preventing hepatic insulin resistance, although the mechanism remains uncovered. Here we report that wake-active hypothalamic orexin system plays a key role in this regulation. Wild-type mice showed a daily rhythm in blood glucose levels peaked at awake period; however, the glucose rhythm was disappeared in orexin knockout mice despite normal feeding rhythm. Central administration of orexin A during nighttime awake period acutely elevated blood glucose levels but subsequently lowered daytime glucose levels in normal and diabetic db/db mice. The glucose-elevating and -lowering effects of orexin A were suppressed by adrenergic antagonists and hepatic parasympathectomy, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, including Pepck, were increased and decreased by orexin A at nanomolar and femtomolar doses, respectively. These results indicate that orexin can bidirectionally regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis via control of autonomic balance, leading to generation of the daily blood glucose oscillation. Furthermore, during aging, orexin deficiency enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver, and caused impairment of hepatic insulin signaling and abnormal gluconeogenic activity in pyruvate tolerance test. Collectively, the daily glucose rhythm under control of orexin appears to be important for maintaining ER homeostasis, thereby preventing insulin resistance in the liver.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy--a loss of muscle tone generally triggered by certain strong emotions with sudden onset. The underlying cause of most cases of human narcolepsy is a loss of neurons that produce hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin). These cells normally serve to drive and synchronize the activity of monoaminergic and cholinergic cells. Sleepiness results from the reduced activity of monoaminergic, cholinergic and other cells that are normally activated by Hcrt neurons, as well as from the loss of Hcrt itself. Cataplexy is caused by an episodic loss of activity in noradrenergic cells that support muscle tone, and a linked activation of a medial medullary cell population that suppresses muscle tone. Current treatments for narcolepsy include stimulants to combat sleepiness and antidepressants to reduce cataplexy. Sodium oxybate produces both reductions in cataplexy and improved waking alertness. Future treatments are likely to include Hcrt or Hcrt agonists to reverse the underlying neurochemical deficit.},

The symbiosis of our extended genome plays a role in host homeostasis and energy extraction from diet. In this article, we summarize some of the studies that have advanced the understanding of the microbiome and its effects on metabolism, obesity, and health. Metagenomic studies demonstrated that certain mixes of gut microbiota may protect or predispose the host to obesity. Furthermore, microbiota transplantation studies in germ-free murine models showed that the efficient energy extraction traits of obese-type gut flora are transmissible. The proposed methods by which the microbiome may contribute to obesity include increasing dietary energy harvest, promoting fat deposition, and triggering systemic inflammation. Future treatments for obesity may involve modulation of gut microbiota using probiotics or prebiotics.},

abstract = {Hypothalamic excitatory hypocretin (orexin) neurons have been discovered in 1998 and found to have widespread projections to basal forebrain, monoaminergic and cholinergic brainstem, and spinal cord regions. The hypocretin system is influenced both neuronally (e.g. suprachiasmatic nucleus, GABAergic, cholinergic and aminergic brainstem nuclei) as well as metabolically (e.g. glucose, ghrelin, and leptin). Physiologically the hypocretin system has been implicated in the regulation of behaviours that are associated with wakefulness, locomotion, and feeding. A role in REM sleep, neuroendocrine, autonomic and metabolic functions has also been suggested. Pathophysiologically a deficient hypocretin neurotransmission has been found in human narcolepsy and (engineered) animal models of the disorder. Different mechanisms are involved including (1) degeneration of hypocretin neurons (mice), (2) hypocretin ligand deficiency (humans, mice, dogs), (3) hypocretin receptor deficiency (mice, dogs). Reports of low hypocretin-1 cerebrospinal fluid levels in neurologic conditions (e.g. Guillain-Barr?? syndrome, traumatic brain injury, hypothalamic lesions) with and without sleep-wake disturbances and, on the other hand, observations of normal levels in about 11{\%} of narcoleptics raise questions about the exact nature and pathophysiological base of the link between hypocretin deficiency and clinical manifestations in human narcolepsy.},

abstract = {Background: Hypocretins, excitatory neuropeptides at monoaminergic synapses, appear to regulate human sleep-wake cycles. Undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are seen in narcolepsy, which is frequently associated with secondary depression. Shortened rapid eye movement latency is observed in both narcolepsy and depression. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels have not been reported in mood disorders. Methods: We examined hypocretin-1 levels in 14 control and 15 depressed subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid was drawn continuously in supine subjects for 24 hours with an indwelling intrathecal catheter under entrained light-dark conditions. Depressed subjects were studied before and after 5 weeks of sertraline (n = 10, three nonresponders) or bupropion (n = 5, two nonresponders). Results: Hypocretin-1 levels varied slightly (amplitude 10{\%}) but significantly across the diurnal cycle in control subjects, with amplitude significantly reduced in depression (3{\%}). Levels were lowest at midday, surprising for a hypothetically wake-promoting peptide. Mean hypocretin levels trended higher in depressive than in control subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels decreased modestly but significantly after sertraline (-14{\%}) but not bupropion. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous physiologic findings in depression indicating dampened diurnal variations in hypocretin-1. The finding that sertraline but not bupropion slightly decreased cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 indicates a serotoninergic influence on hypocretin tone. ?? 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Circulating insulin is thought to provide a major feedback signal for the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and food intake, although this signaling appears to be slowed by a time-consuming blood-to-brain transport. Here we show, by recording direct current potentials, a rapid onset of the effects of circulating insulin on human brain activity. Recordings were obtained from 27 men who were intravenously injected with insulin (0.1 mU/kg body wt as bolus) and placebo. In a euglycemic condition, hypoglycemia was prevented, while in the hypoglycemic condition, plasma glucose reached a postinjection nadir of 43 mg/dl. Insulin injection induced a marked negative direct current (DC) potential shift starting within 7 min in all subjects. With euglycemic conditions, the DC potential at 10-60 min postinsulin injection averaged -621.3 microV (compared with preinjection baseline). Hypoglycemia reduced this potential to an average of -331.2 microV. While insulin per se did not affect oscillatory electroencephalographic activity, hypoglycemia peaking 25 min after insulin injection was accompanied by an immediate increase in theta activity. The rapid emergence of the DC potential shift, reflecting gross ionic changes in brain tissues, indicates that systemic insulin can serve as an immediate feedback signal in the control of hypothalamic and higher brain functions.},

Moreover, this bi-directional change in the profile of brain activity is further associated with a significant increase in the desire for weight-gain promoting high-calorie foods following sleep deprivation, the extent of which is predicted by the subjective severity of sleep loss across participants. These findings provide an explanatory brain mechanism by which insufficient sleep may lead to the development/maintenance of obesity through diminished activity in higher-order cortical evaluation regions, combined with excess subcortical limbic responsivity, resulting in the selection of foods most capable of triggering weight-gain.},

In this report, we review the clinical and physiological aspects of narcolepsy without cataplexy, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures, and the differential diagnoses, and we propose an approach for more accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A group of clinician-scientists experienced in narcolepsy reviewed the literature and convened to discuss current diagnostic tools, and to map out directions for research that should lead to a better understanding and more accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECOMMENDATIONS: To aid in the identification of narcolepsy without cataplexy, we review key indicators of narcolepsy and present a diagnostic algorithm. A detailed clinical history is mainly helpful to rule out other possible causes of chronic sleepiness. The multiple sleep latency test remains the most important measure, and prior sleep deprivation, shift work, or circadian disorders should be excluded by actigraphy or sleep logs. A short REM sleep latency (≤ 15 minutes) on polysomnography can aid in the diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy, although sensitivity is low. Finally, measurement of hypocretin levels can helpful, as levels are low to intermediate in 10{\%} to 30{\%} of narcolepsy without cataplexy patients.},

abstract = {Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, including expenditure from spontaneous physical activity (SPA). Changes in SPA and resulting changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) likely interact with diet to influence risk for obesity. However, previous research on the relationship between diet, physical activity, and energy expenditure has been mixed. The neuropeptide orexin is a driver of SPA, and orexin neuron activity can be manipulated using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). We hypothesized that HFD decreases SPA and NEAT, and that DREADD-mediated activation of orexin neuron signaling would abolish this decrease and produce an increase in NEAT instead. To test these ideas, we characterized behaviors to determine the extent to which access to a high-fat diet (HFD) influences the proportion and probability of engaging in food intake and activity. We then measured NEAT following access to HFD and following a DREADD intervention targeting orexin neurons. Two cohorts of orexin-cre male mice were injected with an excitatory DREADD virus into the caudal hypothalamus, where orexin neurons are concentrated. Mice were then housed in continuous metabolic phenotyping cages (Sable Promethion). Food intake, indirect calorimetry, and SPA were automatically measured every second. For cohort 1 (n = 8), animals were given access to chow, then switched to HFD. For cohort 2 (n = 4/group), half of the animals were given access to HFD, the other access to chow. Then, among animals on HFD, orexin neurons were activated following injections of clozapine n-oxide (CNO). Mice on HFD spent significantly less time eating (p {\textless} 0.01) and more time inactive compared to mice on chow (p {\textless} 0.01). Following a meal, mice on HFD were significantly more likely to engage in periods of inactivity compared to those on chow (p {\textless} 0.05). NEAT was decreased in animals on HFD, and was increased to the NEAT level of control animals following activation of orexin neurons with DREADDs. Food intake (kilocalories) was not significantly different between mice on chow and HFD, yet mice on chow expended more energy per unit of SPA, relative to that in mice consuming HFD. These results suggest that HFD consumption reduces SPA and NEAT, and increases inactivity following a meal. Together, the data suggest a change in the efficiency of energy expenditure based upon diet, such that SPA during HFD burns fewer calories compared to SPA on a standard chow diet.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the cognitive dose response curves for intranasal insulin administration, and determine whether the effects of insulin differ between participants with (epsilon4+) and without (epsilon4-) the APOE- epsilon4 allele. On separate mornings, 33 memory-impaired adults with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 59 normal adults each underwent five intranasal treatment conditions consisting of insulin (10, 20, 40, or 60 IU) or placebo. Cognition was tested 15-minutes post-treatment, and blood was acquired at baseline and 45-minutes post-treatment. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were unaffected by treatment. Insulin administration facilitated recall on two measures of verbal memory in memory-impaired epsilon4- adults, with performance generally peaking at 20 IU. In contrast, memory-impaired epsilon4+ subjects demonstrated a relative decline in verbal memory. Insulin also differentially modulated plasma amyloid-beta for memory-impaired subjects and normal controls, effects that again differed by APOE genotype. These findings suggest that groups with different genetic risks for AD may show differential dose-response curves following intranasal insulin administration.},

METHODS We conducted a cohort study in 17 983 adults who underwent health check-up examinations, including assessments of sleep duration and quality. Diabetes was defined as either HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol (6.5{\%}), or the use of antidiabetic medication. Time-dependent proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between sleep duration and the risk of progression to diabetes. RESULTS During 31,582 person-years of follow-up, 664 incident cases of diabetes were identified; the incidence rate was 21.0 per 1000 person-years. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for progression to diabetes in people with sleep durations of ≤5, 6 and ≥8 h compared with 7 h were 1.68 (95{\%} CI 1.30-2.16), 1.44 (95{\%} CI 1.17-1.76) and 1.23 (95{\%} CI 0.85-1.78), respectively (P for quadratic trend {\textless}0.001). This association was partially mediated by biomarkers of adiposity, fatty liver and insulin resistance. CONCLUSION In this large study in young and middle-aged adults with prediabetes, we found an association between short sleep duration and the risk of progression to diabetes. Our findings suggest that sufficient sleep duration is important for delaying or preventing the progression of prediabetes to diabetes.},

OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The medical literature on fibromyalgia was reviewed from 1955 to March 2014 via MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, with an emphasis on meta-analyses and contemporary evidence-based treatment guidelines. Treatment recommendations are based on the most recent evidence-based guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society and graded from 1 to 5 based on the level of available evidence. FINDINGS: Numerous treatments are available for managing fibromyalgia that are supported by high-quality evidence. These include nonpharmacological therapies (education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological therapies (tricyclics, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Fibromyalgia and other "centralized" pain states are much better understood now than ever before. Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances. Effective treatment for fibromyalgia is now possible.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and is associated with obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors. The "gold standard" glucose clamp and minimal model analysis are two established methods for determining insulin sensitivity in vivo, but neither is easily implemented in large studies. Thus, it is of interest to develop a simple, accurate method for assessing insulin sensitivity that is useful for clinical investigations. We performed both hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp and insulin-modified frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests on 28 nonobese, 13 obese, and 15 type 2 diabetic subjects. We obtained correlations between indexes of insulin sensitivity from glucose clamp studies (SI(Clamp)) and minimal model analysis (SI(MM)) that were comparable to previous reports (r = 0.57). We performed a sensitivity analysis on our data and discovered that physiological steady state values [i.e. fasting insulin (I(0)) and glucose (G(0))] contain critical information about insulin sensitivity. We defined a quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI = 1/[log(I(0)) + log(G(0))]) that has substantially better correlation with SI(Clamp) (r = 0.78) than the correlation we observed between SI(MM) and SI(Clamp). Moreover, we observed a comparable overall correlation between QUICKI and SI(Clamp) in a totally independent group of 21 obese and 14 nonobese subjects from another institution. We conclude that QUICKI is an index of insulin sensitivity obtained from a fasting blood sample that may be useful for clinical research.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES The rise in obesity has been paralleled by a decline in sleep duration in epidemiological studies. However, the potential mechanisms linking energy balance and the sleep/wake cycle are not well understood. We aimed to examine the effects of manipulating energy balance on the sleep/wake cycle. METHODS Twelve healthy normal weight men were housed in a clinical research facility and studied at three time points: baseline, after energy balance was disrupted by 2 days of caloric restriction to 10{\%} of energy requirements, and after energy balance was restored by 2 days of ad libitum/free feeding. Sleep architecture, duration of sleep stages, and sleep-associated respiratory parameters were measured by polysomnography. RESULTS Two days of caloric restriction significantly increased the duration of deep (stage 4) sleep (16.8{\%} to 21.7{\%} of total sleep time; P = 0.03); an effect which was entirely reversed upon free feeding (P = 0.01). Although the apnea-hypopnea index stayed within the reference range ({\textless} 5 events per hour), it decreased significantly from caloric restriction to free feeding (P = 0.03). Caloric restriction was associated with a marked fall in leptin (P {\textless} 0.001) and insulin levels (P = 0.002). The fall in orexin levels from baseline to caloric restriction correlated positively with duration of stage 4 sleep (Spearman rho = 0.83, P = 0.01) and negatively with the number of awakenings in caloric restriction (Spearman rho = -0.79, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that changes in energy homeostasis directly and reversibly impact on the sleep/wake cycle. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for investigating the association between sleep duration and obesity risk.},

abstract = {Orexins are a pair of neuropeptides expressed by a population of neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Prepro-orexin- or orexin receptor type 2-deficient animals exhibit a phenotype remarkably similar to the human sleep disorder, narcolepsy, which is characterized by sleep/wakefulness fragmentation. Human narcolepsy is known to be associated with metabolic abnormalities, including an increased frequency of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Complex disruption of energy homeostasis in orexin neuron-deficient transgenic mice (orexin/ataxin-3 mice) is also manifested as late-onset obesity despite eating less. Here, we report that the development of obesity in orexin neuron-ablated narcoleptic mice is critically dependent on their genetic background and environmental factors, and the phenotype is different from that of prepro-orexin knockout mice even under the same genetic background and environmental factors, suggesting that factors that co-localize in orexin neurons might have important roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Our observation also suggests that the obesity observed in orexin neuron-deficient narcolepsy is dependent on the genetic background and environmental factors. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Adipose tissue, defined as white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), is a biological caloric reservoir that expands in response to over-nutrition and releases lipids in response to energy deficit. The WAT primarily stores energy as triglycerides, whereas BAT dissipates chemical energy as heat. In mammals, the BAT is a key site for heat production and an attractive target to promote weight loss. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) exerts a direct control at the cellular and molecular levels in adiposity. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) provides a complex homeostatic control to specifically coordinate function and crosstalk of both fat pads, as indicated by the increase of the sympathetic outflow to BAT, in response to cold and high-fat diet, but also by the increase or decrease of the sympathetic outflow to selected WAT depots, in response to different lipolytic requirements of these two conditions. More recently, a role has been attributed to the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in modulating both adipose tissue insulin-mediated glucose uptake and fatty free acid (FFA) metabolism in an anabolic way and its endocrine function. The regulation of adipose tissue is unlikely to be limited to the autonomic control, since a number of signaling cytokines and neuropeptides play an important role, as well. In this review we report some experimental evidences about the role played by both the ANS and orexins into different fat pads, related to food intake and energy expenditure, with a special emphasis on body weight status and fat mass (FM) content.},

abstract = {Recently, hypocretins have been implicated in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized particularly by the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Hypocretins, which stimulate food intake, have been reported to be absent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the majority of patients suffering from narcolepsy. Because these patients also display an increased body mass index (BMI), it has been suggested that disturbances in metabolism and food intake regulation may be present. To further investigate these presumed alterations, we studied the production of leptin, a fat-cell-derived hormone signaling to the brain the size of the adipose tissue. We measured the levels of leptin in serum and CSF from 15 narcoleptic patients and compared the results to those from age-, sex- and BMI-matched control groups of depressive patients and patients suffering from a noninflammatory neurological disorder. Compared to both control groups, leptin levels in serum, but not in the CSF, were significantly reduced in narcoleptic patients by more than 50{\%}. These results support the hypothesis that human narcolepsy is accompanied by complex alterations of the regulation of food intake and metabolism. The significance of these alterations for the core symptomatology of narcolepsy should be a target of future research.},

@article{Ripley2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the specificity of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels in narcolepsy and explore the potential role of hypocretins in other neurologic disorders. METHODS: A method to measure hypocretin-1 in 100 microL of crude CSF sample was established and validated. CSF hypocretin-1 was measured in 42 narcolepsy patients (ages 16-70 years), 48 healthy controls (ages 22-77 years,) and 235 patients with various other neurologic conditions (ages 0-85 years). RESULTS: As previously reported, CSF hypocretin-1 levels were undetectably low ({\textless}100 pg/mL) in 37 of 42 narcolepsy subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels were detectable in all controls (224-653 pg/mL) and all neurologic patients (117-720 pg/mL), with the exception of three patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS). Hypocretin-1 was within the control range in most neurologic patients tested, including patients with AD, PD, and MS. Low but detectable levels (100-194 pg/mL) were found in a subset of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, intracranial tumors, craniocerebral trauma, CNS infections, and GBS. CONCLUSIONS: Undetectable CSF hypocretin-1 levels are highly specific to narcolepsy and rare cases of GBS. Measuring hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients suspected of narcolepsy is a useful diagnostic procedure. Low hypocretin levels are also observed in a large range of neurologic conditions, most strikingly in subjects with head trauma. These alterations may reflect focal lesions in the hypothalamus, destruction of the blood brain barrier, or transient or chronic hypofunction of the hypothalamus. Future research in this area is needed to establish functional significance.},

We show that injection of orexin-A into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of mice or rats increased glucose uptake and promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, but not in white adipose tissue, by activating the sympathetic nervous system. These effects of orexin were blunted in mice lacking ??-adrenergic receptors but were restored by forced expression of the ??2-adrenergic receptor in both myocytes and nonmyocyte cells of skeletal muscle. Orexin neurons are activated by conditioned sweet tasting and directly excite VMH neurons, thereby increasing muscle glucose metabolism and its insulin sensitivity. Orexin and its receptor in VMH thus play a key role in the regulation of muscle glucose metabolism associated with highly motivated behavior by activating muscle sympathetic nerves and ??2-adrenergic signaling. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recent evidence from basal studies has further sparked interest in the involvement of daily rhythms (and their disruption) in the development of obesity and T2DM. Most living organisms have molecular clocks in almost every tissue, which govern rhythmicity in many domains of physiology, such as rest/activity rhythms, feeding/fasting rhythms, and hormonal secretion.

abstract = {Compared to a few decades ago, adults, as well as children, sleep less. Sleeping as little as possible is often seen as an admirable behavior in contemporary society. However, sleep plays a major role in neuroendocrine function and glucose metabolism. Evidence that the curtailment of sleep duration may have adverse health effects has emerged in the past 10 years. Accumulating evidence from both epidemiologic studies and well-controlled laboratory studies indicates that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and weight gain. The present chapter reviews epidemiologic studies in adults and children and laboratory studies in young adults indicating that sleep restriction results in metabolic and endocrine alterations, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, increased evening concentrations of cortisol, increased levels of ghrelin, decreased levels of leptin and increased hunger and appetite. Altogether, the evidence points to a possible role of decreased sleep duration in the current epidemic of obesity. Bedtime extension in short sleepers should be explored as a novel behavioral intervention that may prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss. Avoiding sleep deprivation may help to prevent the development of obesity, particularly in children.},

abstract = {Shortened nocturnal sleep impairs morning glucose tolerance. The underlying mechanism of this effect is supposed to involve a reduced fraction of slow wave sleep (SWS). However, it remains unanswered if impaired glucose tolerance occurs due to specific SWS reduction or a general disturbance of sleep. Sixteen healthy men participated in three experimental conditions in a crossover design: SWS suppression, rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep disturbance, and regular sleep. Selective sleep stage disturbance was performed by means of an acoustic tone (532Hz) with gradually rising sound intensity. Blood concentrations of glucoregulatory parameters were measured upon an oral glucose tolerance test the next morning. Our data show that morning plasma glucose and serum insulin responses were significantly increased after selective SWS suppression. Moreover, SWS suppression reduced postprandial insulin sensitivity up to 20{\%}, as determined by Matsuda Index. Contrastingly, disturbed REM-sleep did not affect glucose homeostasis. We conclude that specifically SWS reduction is critically involved in the impairment of glucose tolerance associated with disturbed sleep. Therefore, glucose metabolism in subjects predisposed to reduced SWS (e.g. depression, aging, obstructive sleep apnea, pharmacological treatment) should be thoroughly monitored.},

After taking into account the important roles of adiposity, age, sex and race/ethnicity, up to 50{\%} of the individual variability in insulin resistance remains unexplained. In recent years, evidence has accumulated to support a role for sleep disturbances, including insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality and insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnoea, as independent risk factors for the development and exacerbation of insulin resistance. The present review summarizes the evidence. We will start with a brief introduction to sleep and its disorders and then examine in succession the role of the three major types of sleep disturbances of modern society, namely insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality and/or insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of the polycystic ovary syndrome, the most common endocrine pathology in women, and the last section of this review will discuss the role of obstructive sleep apnoea in the insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances of polycystic ovary syndrome.},

In this systematic review, we aimed to assess validity, responsiveness, reliability and measurement error of BIA methods in estimating {\%}BF in children and adolescents.We searched for relevant studies in Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane through November 2012. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, extracted data and rated methodological quality of the included studies. We performed a best evidence synthesis to synthesize the results, thereby excluding studies of poor quality. We included 50 published studies. Mean differences between BIA and reference methods (gold standard [criterion validity] and convergent measures of body composition [convergent validity]) were considerable and ranged from negative to positive values, resulting in conflicting evidence for criterion validity. We found strong evidence for a good reliability, i.e. (intra-class) correlations ≥0.82. However, test-retest mean differences ranged from 7.5{\%} to 13.4{\%} of total {\%}BF in the included study samples, indicating considerable measurement error. Our systematic review suggests that BIA is a practical method to estimate {\%}BF in children and adolescents. However, validity and measurement error are not satisfactory.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE It remains unclear how many hours of sleep are associated with the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the dose-response relationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS PubMed and Embase were searched up to 20 March 2014 for prospective observational studies that assessed the relationship of sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes. Both semiparametric and parametric methods were used. RESULTS Ten articles with 11 reports were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A total of 18,443 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained among 482,502 participants with follow-up periods ranging from 2.5 to 16 years. A U-shaped dose-response relationship was observed between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with the lowest risk observed at a sleep duration category of 7-8 h per day. Compared with 7-h sleep duration per day, the pooled relative risks for type 2 diabetes were 1.09 (95{\%} CI 1.04-1.15) for each 1-h shorter sleep duration among individuals who slept {\textless}7 h per day and 1.14 (1.03-1.26) for each 1-h increment of sleep duration among individuals with longer sleep duration. CONCLUSIONS Our dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies shows a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with the lowest type 2 diabetes risk at 7-8 h per day of sleep duration. Both short and long sleep duration are associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, underscoring the importance of appropriate sleep duration in the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives:Rates of obesity are greatest in middle age. Obesity is associated with altered activity of brain networks sensing food-related stimuli and internal signals of energy balance, which modulate eating behaviour. The impact of healthy mid-life ageing on these processes has not been characterised. We therefore aimed to investigate changes in brain responses to food cues, and the modulatory effect of meal ingestion on such evoked neural activity, from young adulthood to middle age.Subjects/Methods:Twenty-four healthy, right-handed subjects, aged 19.5-52.6 years, were studied on separate days after an overnight fast, randomly receiving 50 ml water or 554 kcal mixed meal before functional brain magnetic resonance imaging while viewing visual food cues.Results:Across the group, meal ingestion reduced food cue-evoked activity of amygdala, putamen, insula and thalamus, and increased activity in precuneus and bilateral parietal cortex. Corrected for body mass index, ageing was associated with decreasing food cue-evoked activation of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and precuneus, and increasing activation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), bilateral temporal lobe and posterior cingulate in the fasted state. Ageing was also positively associated with the difference in food cue-evoked activation between fed and fasted states in the right DLPFC, bilateral amygdala and striatum, and negatively associated with that of the left orbitofrontal cortex and VLPFC, superior frontal gyrus, left middle and temporal gyri, posterior cingulate and precuneus. There was an overall tendency towards decreasing modulatory effects of prior meal ingestion on food cue-evoked regional brain activity with increasing age.Conclusions:Healthy ageing to middle age is associated with diminishing sensitivity to meal ingestion of visual food cue-evoked activity in brain regions that represent the salience of food and direct food-associated behaviour. Reduced satiety sensing may have a role in the greater risk of obesity in middle age.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 14 January 2014; doi:10.1038/ijo.2013.237.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent condition with complications including blindness and kidney failure. Evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes is associated with a sedentary lifestyle, with physical activity demonstrated to increase glucose uptake and improve glycaemic control. Proposed mechanisms for these effects include the maintenance and improvement of insulin sensitivity via increased glucose transporter type four production. The optimal mode, frequency, intensity and duration of exercise for the improvement of insulin sensitivity are however yet to be identified. We review the evidence from 34 published studies addressing the effects on glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity of aerobic exercise, resistance training and both combined. Effect sizes and confidence intervals are reported for each intervention and meta-analysis presented. The quality of the evidence is tentatively graded, and recommendations for best practice proposed. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Sleep has been proposed to be a physiological adaptation to conserve energy, but little research has examined this proposed function of sleep in humans. We quantified effects of sleep, sleep deprivation and recovery sleep on whole-body total daily energy expenditure (EE) and on EE during the habitual day and nighttime. We also determined effects of sleep stage during baseline and recovery sleep on EE. Seven healthy participants aged 22 ± 5 years (mean ± s.d.) maintained ∼8 h per night sleep schedules for 1 week before the study and consumed a weight-maintenance diet for 3 days prior to and during the laboratory protocol. Following a habituation night, subjects lived in a whole-room indirect calorimeter for 3 days. The first 24 h served as baseline – 16 h wakefulness, 8 h scheduled sleep – and this was followed by 40 h sleep deprivation and 8 h scheduled recovery sleep. Findings show that, compared to baseline, 24 h EE was significantly increased by ∼7{\%} during the first 24 h of sleep deprivation and was significantly decreased by ∼5{\%} during recovery, which included hours awake 25-40 and 8 h recovery sleep. During the night time, EE was significantly increased by ∼32{\%} on the sleep deprivation night and significantly decreased by ∼4{\%} during recovery sleep compared to baseline. Small differences in EE were observed among sleep stages, but wakefulness during the sleep episode was associated with increased energy expenditure. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that sleep conserves energy and that sleep deprivation increases total daily EE in humans.},

abstract = {The hypocretins (Hcrts, also known as orexins) are two peptides, both synthesized by a small group of neurons, most of which are in the lateral hypothalamic and perifornical regions of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamic Hcrt system directly and strongly innervates and potently excites noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic neurons. Hcrt also has a major role in modulating the release of glutamate and other amino acid transmitters. Behavioral investigations have revealed that Hcrt is released at high levels in active waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and at minimal levels in non-REM sleep. Hcrt release in waking is increased markedly during periods of increased motor activity relative to levels in quiet, alert waking. Evidence for a role for Hcrt in food intake regulation is inconsistent. I hypothesize that Hcrt's major role is to facilitate motor activity tonically and phasically in association with motivated behaviors and to coordinate this facilitation with the activation of attentional and sensory systems. Degeneration of Hcrt neurons or genetic mutations that prevent the normal synthesis of Hcrt or of its receptors causes human and animal narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is characterized by an impaired ability to maintain alertness for long periods and by sudden losses of muscle tone (cataplexy). Administration of Hcrt can reverse symptoms of narcolepsy in animals, may be effective in treating human narcolepsy, and may affect a broad range of motivated behaviors.},

We demonstrate that hypothalamic orexin neurons monitor indicators of energy balance and mediate adaptive augmentation of arousal in response to fasting. Activity of isolated orexin neurons is inhibited by glucose and leptin and stimulated by ghrelin. Orexin expression of normal and ob/ob mice correlates negatively with changes in blood glucose, leptin, and food intake. Transgenic mice, in which orexin neurons are ablated, fail to respond to fasting with increased wakefulness and activity. These findings indicate that orexin neurons provide a crucial link between energy balance and arousal.},

abstract = {Social norms are implicit codes of conduct that provide a guide to appropriate action. There is ample evidence that social norms about eating have a powerful effect on both food choice and amounts consumed. This review explores the reasons why people follow social eating norms and the factors that moderate norm following. It is proposed that eating norms are followed because they provide information about safe foods and facilitate food sharing. Norms are a powerful influence on behaviour because following (or not following) norms is associated with social judgements. Norm following is more likely when there is uncertainty about what constitutes correct behaviour and when there is greater shared identity with the norm referent group. Social norms may affect food choice and intake by altering self-perceptions and/or by altering the sensory/hedonic evaluation of foods. The same neural systems that mediate the rewarding effects of food itself are likely to reinforce the following of eating norms.},

abstract = {The steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of $\beta$-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient $\beta$-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and $\beta$-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p {\textless} 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p {\textless} 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient $\beta$-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31{\%} for insulin resistance and 32{\%} for $\beta$-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Animal studies and pilot experiments in men indicate that the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin limits food intake, and raise the question of its potential to improve metabolic control in obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS We compared the effect of central nervous oxytocin administration (24 IU) via the intranasal route on ingestive behaviour and metabolic function in 18 young obese men with the results in a group of 20 normal-weight men. In double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments, ad libitum food intake from a test buffet was examined in fasted subjects 45 min after oxytocin administration, followed by the assessment of postprandial, reward-driven snack intake. Energy expenditure was repeatedly assessed by indirect calorimetry and blood was sampled to determine concentrations of blood glucose and hormones. RESULTS Oxytocin markedly reduced hunger-driven food intake in the fasted state in obese but not in normal-weight men, and led to a reduction in snack consumption in both groups, whereas energy expenditure remained generally unaffected. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis secretion and the postprandial rise in plasma glucose were blunted by oxytocin in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Oxytocin exerts an acutely inhibitory impact on food intake that is enhanced rather than decreased in obese compared with normal-weight men. This pattern puts it in contrast to other metabolically active neuropeptides and bodes well for clinical applications of oxytocin in the treatment of metabolic disorders.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 13 September 2016; doi:10.1038/ijo.2016.149.},

abstract = {The neurochemical underpinnings of sleep's contribution to the establishment and maintenance of memory traces are largely unexplored. Considering that intranasal insulin administration to the CNS improves memory functions in healthy and memory-impaired humans, we tested whether brain insulin signaling and sleep interact to enhance memory consolidation in healthy participants. We investigated the effect of intranasal insulin on sleep-associated neurophysiological and neuroendocrine parameters and memory consolidation in 16 men and 16 women (aged 18-30 yrs), who learned a declarative word-pair task and a procedural finger sequence tapping task in the evening before intranasal insulin (160 IU) or placebo administration and eight hours of nocturnal sleep. On the subsequent evening, they learned interfering word-pairs and a new finger sequence before retrieving the original memories. Insulin increased growth hormone concentrations in the first night-half and EEG delta power during the second 90 min of NonREM sleep. Insulin treatment impaired the acquisition of new contents in both the declarative and procedural memory systems on the next day, whereas retrieval of original memories was unchanged. Results indicate that sleep-associated memory consolidation is not a primary mediator of insulin's acute memory-improving effect, but that the peptide acts on mechanisms that diminish the subsequent encoding of novel information. Thus, by inhibiting processes of active forgetting during sleep, central nervous insulin might reduce the interfering influence of encoding new information.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 08 October 2015. doi:10.1038/npp.2015.312.},

Within the GI tract, the microbiota have a mutually beneficial relationship with their host that maintains normal mucosal immune function, epithelial barrier integrity, motility, and nutrient absorption. Disruption of this relationship alters GI function and disease susceptibility. Animal studies suggest that perturbations of behavior, such as stress, can change the composition of the microbiota; these changes are associated with increased vulnerability to inflammatory stimuli in the GI tract. The mechanisms that underlie these alterations are likely to involve stress-induced changes in GI physiology that alter the habitat of enteric bacteria. Furthermore, experimental perturbation of the microbiota can alter behavior, and the behavior of germ-free mice differs from that of colonized mice. Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between behavior and the microbiota could provide insight into the pathogenesis of functional and inflammatory bowel disorders.},

abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes and obesity is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and the causes of this pandemic are not fully understood. Chronic sleep curtailment is a behavior that has developed over the past 2–3 decades. Laboratory and epidemiological studies suggest that sleep loss may play a role in the increased prevalence of diabetes and/or obesity. Current data suggest the relationship between sleep restriction, weight gain and diabetes risk may involve at least three pathways: (1) alterations in glucose metabolism; (2) upregulation of appetite; and (3) decreased energy expenditure. The present article reviews the current evidence in support of these three mechanisms that might link short sleep and increased obesity and diabetes risk.},

We performed a random effects meta-analysis for each surrogate measure to integrate the correlation coefficients of the different studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The OGTT-based surrogate measures with the strongest pooled correlations (r) to the HEC were the Stumvoll metabolic clearance rate (Stumvoll MCR; r = 0.70 [95{\%} CI 0.61, 0.77], n = 5), oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS; r = 0.70 [0.57, 0.80], n = 6), the Matsuda index (r = 0.67 [0.61, 0.73], n = 19), the Stumvoll insulin sensitivity index (Stumvoll ISI; r = 0.67 [0.60, 0.72], n = 8) and the Gutt index (r = 0.65 [0.60, 0.69], n = 6). The fasting surrogate indices that correlated most strongly with the HEC and had narrow 95{\%} CIs were the revised QUICKI (r = 0.68 [0.58, 0.77], n = 7), the QUICKI (r = 0.61 [0.55, 0.65], n = 35), the log HOMA-IR (r = -0.60 [-0.66, -0.53], n = 22) and the computer generated HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-{\%}S; r = 0.57 [0.46, 0.67], n = 5).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The revised QUICKI fasting surrogate measure appears to be as good as the OGTT-based Stumvoll MCR, OGIS, Matsuda, Stumvoll ISI and Gutt indices for estimating insulin sensitivity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to find a simple intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) that can be used to estimate insulin sensitivity.

METHODS: In 20 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 51 years (mean, 28) comparisons were made between kinetic parameters derived from a 12-sample, 75-min IVGTT and the M(bw) (glucose uptake) obtained during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. Plasma glucose was used to calculate the volume of distribution (V(d)) and the clearance (CL) of the injected glucose bolus. The plasma insulin response was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC(ins)). Uptake of glucose during the clamp was corrected for body weight (M(bw)).

RESULTS: There was a 7-fold variation in M(bw). Algorithms based on the slope of the glucose-elimination curve (CL/V(d)) in combination with AUC(ins) obtained during the IVGTT showed statistically significant correlations with M(bw), the linearity being r(2) = 0.63-0.83. The best algorithms were associated with a 25-75th prediction error ranging from -10{\%} to +10{\%}. Sampling could be shortened to 30-40 min without loss of linearity or precision.

CONCLUSION: Simple measures of glucose and insulin kinetics during an IVGTT can predict between 2/3 and 4/5 of the insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {The pancreatic hormone, insulin, has been hypothesized to be an important regulator of food intake. Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that exogenous insulin, in doses that do not affect blood glucose, reliably suppresses food intake and body weight. However, previous experiments have utilized a long-term delivery paradigm, in which insulin is administered via osmotic minipump and changes in body weight and food intake are measured across days. In separate experiments, we report that acute central injections of insulin can reduce food intake. In Experiment 1, injection of insulin (8 mU) into the third cerebral ventricle reliably suppressed intake of pelleted rat chow beginning at onset of the rats' dark phase. In Experiment 2, central insulin reliably and dose dependently suppressed intake of a 1-h 15{\%} sucrose meal in the middle of the light phase. These data suggest that insulin can reduce food intake in acute delivery paradigms and provide another means by which to assess the roles of other central systems in the mediation of insulin's effects on energy homeostasis.},

abstract = {Experiments in rodents suggest that hypothalamic insulin signaling essentially contributes to the acute control of peripheral glucose homeostasis. Against this background, we investigated in healthy humans whether intranasal (IN) insulin, which is known to effectively reach the brain compartment, impacts systemic glucose metabolism. Twenty overnight-fasted healthy, normal-weight men were IN administered 210 and 420 international units [IU] (10 and 20 IU every 15 min) of the insulin analog aspart (ins-asp) and placebo, respectively, during experimental sessions lasting 6 h. The use of ins-asp rather than human insulin enabled us to disentangle exogenous and endogenous insulin kinetics. IN insulin dose-dependently decreased plasma glucose concentrations while reducing C-peptide and attenuating endogenous insulin levels. However, we also observed a slight dose-dependent permeation of ins-asp into the circulation. In control experiments mimicking the systemic but not the central nervous uptake of the IN 210 IU dose via intravenous infusion of ins-asp at a dose of 0.12 IU/kg/24 h (n = 10), we obtained essentially identical effects on fasting plasma glucose concentrations. This pattern indicates that sustained IN insulin administration to the human brain to enhance central nervous insulin signaling does not acutely alter systemic glucose homeostasis beyond effects accounted for by concurrent mild hyperinsulinemia.},

Subsequent studies have revealed the importance of orexins to a variety of physiological functions, including brown fat thermogenesis, sleep/wake cycles, physical activity, and cognition. We aim to elucidate the various roles of orexins and discuss how these multiple functions are interlinked. We explain that although the unique dual roles of orexins in increasing feeding while concomitantly elevating energy expenditure appear counterproductive, they are necessary for physiological scenarios during which simultaneous stimulation of energy expenditure and feeding occur, namely diet-induced thermogenesis and arousal from hibernation. The position of orexins at the interface between sleep/wake cycles, energy homeostasis, and environmental factors has important implications in the treatment of obesity.},

Based on previous results indicating a prevalence of insulin receptors in limbic and hippocampal regions as well as improvements in memory with systemic insulin administration, we expected that intranasal administration of insulin improves primarily hippocampus dependent declaration memory function. Also, improvements in mood were expected. We investigated the effects of 8 weeks of intranasal administration of insulin (human regular insulin 4 x 40 IU/d) on declarative memory (immediate and delayed recall of word lists), attention (Stroop test), and mood in 38 healthy subjects (24 males) in a double blind, between-subject comparison. Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels did not differ between the placebo and insulin conditions. Delayed recall of words significantly improved after 8 weeks of intranasal insulin administration (words recalled, Placebo 2.92±1.00, Insulin 6.20±1.03, p{\textless}0.05). Moreover, subjects after insulin reported signs of enhanced mood, such as reduced anger (p{\textless}0.02) and enhanced self-confidence (p{\textless}0.03).

Glucose was injected into conscious dogs at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg. The measured time course of insulin was regarded as the "input," and the falling glucose concentration as the "output" of the physiological system storing and using glucose. Seven mathematical models of glucose uptake were compared to identify the representation most capable of simulating glucose disappearance. One specific nonlinear model was superior in that it 1) predicted the time course of glucose after glucose injection, 2) had four parameters that could be precisely estimated, and 3) described individual experiments with similar parameter values. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), defined as the dependence of fractional glucose disappearance on plasma insulin, was the ratio of two parameters of the chosen model and could be estimated with good reproducibility from the 300 mg/kg injection experiments (SI = 7.00 X 10(-4) +/- 24{\%} (coefficient of variation) min-1/(microU/ml) (n = 8)). Thus, from a single glucose injection it is possible to obtain a quantitative index of insulin sensitivity that may have clinical applicability.

abstract = {Peripheral insulin acts on the brain to regulate metabolic functions, in particular decreasing food intake and body weight. This concept has been supported by studies in humans relying on the intranasal route of administration, a method that permits the direct permeation of insulin into the CNS without substantial absorption into the blood stream. We investigated if intranasal insulin administration before nocturnal sleep, a period of reduced metabolic activity and largely absent external stimulation, affects food intake and energy turnover on the subsequent morning. Healthy participants who were either young (16 men and 16 women; mean age ± SEM, 23.68 ± 0.40 years, mean BMI ± SEM, 22.83 ± 0.33 kg/m 2) or elderly (10 men, 9 women; 70.79 ± 0.81 years, 25.27 ± 0.60 kg/m 2) were intranasally administered intranasal insulin (160 IU) or placebo before a night of regular sleep that was polysomnographically recorded. Blood was repeatedly sampled for the determination of circulating glucose, insulin, leptin and total ghrelin. In the morning, energy expenditure was assessed via indirect calorimetry and subjects were offered a large standardized breakfast buffet from which they could eat ad libitum. Insulin compared to placebo reduced breakfast size by around 110 kcal (1,054.43 ± 50.91 vs. 1,162.36 ± 64.69 kcal, p = 0.0095), in particular decreasing carbohydrate intake (502.70 ± 25.97 vs. 589.82 ± 35.03 kcal, p = 0.0080). This effect was not dependent on sex or age (all p {\textgreater} 0.11). Sleep architecture, blood glucose and hormonal parameters as well as energy expenditure were not or only marginally affected. Results show that intranasal insulin administered to healthy young and elderly humans before sleep exerts a delayed inhibitory effect on energy intake that is not compensated for by changes in energy expenditure. While the exact underlying mechanisms cannot be derived from our data, findings indicate a long-lasting catabolic effect of central nervous insulin delivery that extends across sleep and might be of particular relevance for potential therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW To highlight the adverse metabolic effects of sleep disruption and to open ground for research aimed at preventive measures. This area of research is especially relevant given the increasing prevalence of voluntary sleep curtailment, sleep disorders, diabetes, and obesity. RECENT FINDINGS Epidemiological studies have established an association between decreased self-reported sleep duration and an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Experimental laboratory studies have demonstrated that decreasing either the amount or quality of sleep decreases insulin sensitivity and decreases glucose tolerance. Experimental sleep restriction also causes physiological and behavioral changes that promote a positive energy balance. Although sleep restriction increases energy expenditure because of increased wakefulness, it can lead to a disproportionate increase in food intake, decrease in physical activity, and weight gain. SUMMARY Sleep disruption has detrimental effects on metabolic health. These insights may help in the development of new preventive and therapeutic approaches against obesity and T2D based on increasing the quality and/or quantity of sleep.},

We investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on ingestion and metabolic function in healthy men. Food intake in the fasted state was examined 45 min after neuropeptide administration, followed by the assessment of olfaction and reward-driven snack intake in the absence of hunger. Energy expenditure was registered by indirect calorimetry, and blood was repeatedly sampled to determine concentrations of blood glucose and hormones. Oxytocin markedly reduced snack consumption, restraining, in particular, the intake of chocolate cookies by 25{\%}. Oxytocin, moreover, attenuated basal and postprandial levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and curbed the meal-related rise in plasma glucose. Energy expenditure and hunger-driven food intake as well as olfactory function were not affected. Our results indicate that oxytocin, beyond its role in social bonding, regulates nonhomeostatic, reward-related energy intake, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and the glucoregulatory response to food intake in humans. These effects can be assumed to converge with the psychosocial function of oxytocin and imply possible applications in the treatment of metabolic disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of obesity among patients with narcolepsy, to estimate associated long-term health risks on the basis of waist circumference, and to distinguish the impact of hypocretin deficiency from that of increased daytime sleepiness (i.e., reduced physical activity) on these anthropometric measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A cross-sectional, case-control study was conducted. Patients with narcolepsy (n = 138) or idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) (n = 33) were included. Age-matched, healthy members of the Dutch population (Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases and Doetinchem Project; n = 10,526) were used as controls. BMI and waist circumference were determined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Obesity (BMI {\textgreater} or = 30 kg/m(2)) and overweight (BMI 25 to 30 kg/m(2)) occurred more often among narcolepsy patients [prevalence: 33{\%} (narcoleptics) vs. 12.5{\%} (controls) and 43{\%} (narcoleptics) vs. 36{\%} (controls), respectively; both p {\textless} 0.05]. Narcoleptics had a larger waist circumference (mean difference 5 +/- 1.4 cm, p {\textless} 0.001). The BMI of patients with IH was significantly lower than that of narcolepsy patients (25.6 +/- 3.6 vs. 28.5 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2); p = 0.004).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Overweight and obesity occur frequently in patients with narcolepsy. Moreover, these patients have an increased waist circumference, indicating excess fat storage in abdominal depots. The fact that patients with IH had a lower BMI than narcoleptics supports the notion that excessive daytime sleepiness (i.e., inactivity) cannot account for excess body fat in narcoleptic patients.},

In a study of the phylogeny of the insulin receptor, Posner5 reported specific binding of 125I-insulin to membrane preparations from whole brain of rat, monkey and pigeon. Specific receptors for insulin have been detected in the hypothalamus of monkeys but not in the cerebral cortex or thalamus6; other regions of the CNS were not studied. We report here the presence of substantial concentrations of insulin receptors in discrete regions of the CNS of the rat. We detected specific binding of insulin in every area studied, although it differed by as much as five- to 10-fold among regions. The insulin receptor of the cerebral cortex was most extensively characterised, and by all criteria it was indistinguishable from the insulin receptor on classical target tissues (liver, muscle and fat) as well as other cells of humans, rodents710, and other mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates},

abstract = {The lateral hypothalamus is a brain region historically implicated in reward and motivation, but the identity of the neurotransmitters involved are unknown. The orexins (or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons. Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep, these cells also project to reward-associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation, consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding. Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug-seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug-seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward-seeking, drug relapse and addiction.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance plays a major role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and is associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Excellent methods exist for the assessment of insulin sensitivity in the laboratory setting, such as the glucose clamp. However, these methods are not suitable for large population studies, and, thus, surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity based on measurements in a single blood sample have been developed. Recently an index based on the logarithm and the reciprocal of the insulin-glucose product (QUICKI) has been proposed. QUICKI correlated with insulin sensitivity across the entire spectrum of glucose tolerance, but its performance was less satisfactory in normal subjects. Aim of this study was to ascertain whether the inclusion of fasting plasma free fatty acids concentration into QUICKI improves its association with insulin sensitivity in nonobese subjects. To test this hypothesis, we performed a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp [40 mU/(m(2).min)] in 57 young, healthy, nonobese individuals with (n = 17) or without (n = 40) first-degree relatives affected by type 2 diabetes (the former group being an in vivo model of mild insulin resistance). We then compared the clamp-based index of insulin sensitivity with both QUICKI and a revised QUICKI, the latter index including the contribution of fasting free fatty acid concentration as well. The revised QUICKI considerably improved the relationship with the clamp-based index of insulin sensitivity (r = 0.51, P {\textless} 0.0001) with respect to QUICKI (r = 0.27, P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, the revised QUICKI revealed a reduction of insulin sensitivity in the offspring of type 2 diabetes (10{\%}; P {\textless} 0.006) that QUICKI was unable to detect (3{\%}; P = 0.28). In conclusion, this study suggests that the incorporation of fasting free fatty acid level into QUICKI is useful to improve its correlation with the clamp-based index of insulin sensitivity and its discriminatory power in case of mild insulin resistance. Further investigation is needed to ascertain its applicability to patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Hypocretins (orexins) are hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in sleep and energy homeostasis. Hypocretin mutations produce narcolepsy in animal models. In humans, narcolepsy is rarely due to hypocretin mutations, but this system is deficient in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of a small number of patients. A recent study also indicates increased body mass index (BMI) in narcolepsy. The sensitivity of low CSF hypocretin was examined in 38 successive narcolepsy-cataplexy cases [36 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602-positive] and 34 matched controls (15 controls and 19 neurological patients). BMI and CSF leptin levels were also measured. Hypocretin-1 was measurable (169 to 376 pg/ml) in all controls. Levels were unaffected by freezing/thawing or prolonged storage and did not display any concentration gradient. Hypocretin-1 was dramatically decreased ({\textless}100 pg/ml) in 32 of 38 patients (all HLA-positive). Four patients had normal levels (2 HLA-negative). Two HLA-positive patients had high levels (609 and 637 pg/ml). CSF leptin and adjusted BMI were significantly higher in patients versus controls. We conclude that the hypocretin ligand is deficient in most cases of human narcolepsy, providing possible diagnostic applications. Increased BMI and leptin indicate altered energy homeostasis. Sleep and energy metabolism are likely to be functionally connected through the hypocretin system.},

abstract = {AIMS Insulin resistance underlies the etiology of both type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. In pregnancy, insulin resistance is also associated with an unfavorable metabolic programming of the fetus, potentially contributing to a higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the offspring. To assess insulin sensitivity, several methods based on glucose and insulin levels during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) exist. It is unclear how they perform during pregnancy, where physiologically altered metabolism could introduce a bias. METHODS In a cohort comprising 476 non-diabetic subjects undergoing OGTT and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC), we used cross-validation to develop an insulin sensitivity index also based on non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) that could be more robust during pregnancy (NEFA-index). We tested commonly used OGTT-based indexes and the NEFA-index in a different cohort of 42 women during pregnancy and 1 year after delivery. RESULTS The Matsuda and OGIS index failed to detect lower insulin sensitivity during pregnancy as compared to the follow-up OGTT 1 year after delivery (p {\textgreater} 0.09). The new NEFA-index incorporating BMI, plasma insulin and NEFA, but not glucose, clearly indicated lower insulin sensitivity during pregnancy (p {\textless} 0.0001). In the non-pregnant cohort, this NEFA-index correlated well with the gold-standard HEC-based insulin sensitivity index, and outperformed other tested indexes for the prediction of HEC-measured insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS This insulin/NEFA-based approach is feasible, robust, and could be consistently used to estimate insulin sensitivity also during pregnancy.},

Sleep-disordered breathing, sleep duration, and sleep architecture may all influence metabolism and neurohormonal systems, yet no previous study has evaluated these sleep characteristics concurrently in relation to incident hypertension. Our objective was to determine whether incident hypertension is associated with polysomnography measures of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep duration, and sleep architecture in older men. Participants were 784 community-dwelling, ambulatory men ≥65 years of age (mean age: 75.1±4.9 years) from the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study who did not have hypertension at the time of their in-home polysomnography sleep studies (2003-2005) and who returned for follow-up (2007-2009). Of 784 older men included in this report, 243 met criteria for incident hypertension after a mean follow-up of 3.4 years. In unadjusted analyses, incident hypertension was associated with increased hypoxemia, increased sleep stages N1 and N2, and decreased stage N3 (slow wave sleep [SWS]). After adjustment for age, nonwhite race, study site, and body mass index, the only sleep index to remain significantly associated with incident hypertension was SWS percentage (odds ratio for lowest to highest quartile of SWS: 1.83 [95{\%} CI: 1.18 to 2.85]). No attenuation of this association was seen after accounting for sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and indices of sleep-disordered breathing. Percentage time in SWS was inversely associated with incident hypertension, independent of sleep duration and fragmentation, and sleep-disordered breathing. Selective deprivation of SWS may contribute to adverse blood pressure in older men.},

abstract = {This large scale computer-assisted telephone survey was undertaken to explore the prevalence, severity, treatment and impact of chronic pain in 15 European countries and Israel. Screening interviews identified respondents aged ≥18 years with chronic pain for in-depth interviews. 19{\%} of 46,394 respondents willing to participate (refusal rate 46{\%}) had suffered pain for ≥6 months, had experienced pain in the last month and several times during the last week. Their pain intensity was ≥5 on a 10-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (1 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) during last episode of pain. In-depth interviews with 4839 respondents with chronic pain (about 300 per country) showed: 66{\%} had moderate pain (NRS = 5-7), 34{\%} had severe pain (NRS = 8-10), 46{\%} had constant pain, 54{\%} had intermittent pain. 59{\%} had suffered with pain for two to 15 years, 21{\%} had been diagnosed with depression because of their pain, 61{\%} were less able or unable to work outside the home, 19{\%} had lost their job and 13{\%} had changed jobs because of their pain. 60{\%} visited their doctor about their pain 2-9 times in the last six months. Only 2{\%} were currently treated by a pain management specialist. One-third of the chronic pain sufferers were currently not being treated. Two-thirds used non-medication treatments, e.g,. massage (30{\%}), physical therapy (21{\%}), acupuncture (13{\%}). Almost half were taking non-prescription analgesics; 'over the counter' (OTC) NSAIDs (55{\%}), paracetamol (43{\%}), weak opioids (13{\%}). Two-thirds were taking prescription medicines: NSAIDs (44{\%}), weak opioids (23{\%}), paracetamol (18{\%}), COX-2 inhibitors (1-36{\%}), and strong opioids (5{\%}). Forty percent had inadequate management of their pain. Interesting differences between countries were observed, possibly reflecting differences in cultural background and local traditions in managing chronic pain. Conclusions: Chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19{\%} of adult Europeans, seriously affecting the quality of their social and working lives. Very few were managed by pain specialists and nearly half received inadequate pain management. Although differences were observed between the 16 countries, we have documented that chronic pain is a major health care problem in Europe that needs to be taken more seriously. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {The seminal concept proposed by Sir Harold Himsworth more than 75years ago that a large number of patients with diabetes were insulin insensitive', now termed insulin resistance, has now expanded to include several endocrine syndromes, namely those of glucocorticoid excess, and growth hormone excess and deficiency. Synthetic glucocorticoids are increasingly used to treat a wide variety of chronic diseases, whereas the beneficial effects of recombinant growth hormone replacement therapy in children and adults with growth hormone deficiency have now been well-recognized for over 25years. However, clinical and experimental studies have established that increased circulating levels of glucocorticoids and growth hormone can also lead to worsening of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, overt diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Improved understanding of the physiological 24-h rhythmicity of glucocorticoid and growth hormone secretion and its influence on the dawn phenomenon and the Staub-Trauggot effect has therefore led to renewed interest in studies on the mechanisms of insulin resistance induced by exogenous administration of glucocorticoids and growth hormone in humans. In this review, we describe the physiological events that result from the presence of resistance to insulin action at the level of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver, describe the known mechanisms of glucocorticoid- and growth hormone-mediated insulin resistance, and provide an update of the contributions of glucocorticoids and growth hormone to understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and its effects on several endocrine syndromes.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES A link between sleep loss and increased risk for the development of diabetes is now well recognized. The current study investigates whether sleep extension under real-life conditions is a feasible intervention with a beneficial impact on glucose metabolism in healthy adults who are chronically sleep restricted. DESIGN Intervention study. PARTICIPANTS Sixteen healthy non-obese volunteers (25 [23, 27.8] years old, 3 men). INTERVENTIONS Two weeks of habitual time in bed followed by 6 weeks during which participants were instructed to increase their time in bed by one hour per day. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Continuous actigraphy monitoring and daily sleep logs during the entire study. Glucose and insulin were assayed on a single morning blood sample at the end of habitual time in bed and at the end of sleep extension. Home polysomnography was performed during one weekday of habitual time in bed and after 40 days of sleep extension. Sleep time during weekdays increased (mean actigraphic data: +44 ± 34 minutes, P {\textless} 0.0001; polysomnographic data: +49 ± 68 minutes, P = 0.014), without any significant change during weekends. Changes from habitual time in bed to the end of the intervention in total sleep time correlated with changes in glucose (r = +0.53, P = 0.041) and insulin levels (r = -0.60, P = 0.025), as well as with indices of insulin sensitivity (r = +0.76, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS In healthy adults who are chronically sleep restricted, a simple low cost intervention such as sleep extension is feasible and is associated with improvements in fasting insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {Context: Brain insulin is critically involved in the regulation of body weight and memory processing. Long-term administration of intranasal insulin reduces body weight in men, but not in women, while improving hippocampus-dependent memory processing in both genders. Objectives: Our objectives were to assess the effects of a single dose of intranasal insulin on food intake and memory function in men and women, and to determine any gender differences. Methods: A total of 32 healthy, normal-weight subjects (14 men, 18 women) were intranasally administered 160 IU regular human insulin or vehicle before performing a hippocampus-dependent two-dimensional-object location task, a working memory task (digit span), and a hippocampus-independent mirror tracing task. Subsequently, food intake from an ad libitum breakfast buffet was measured. Results: Insulin treatment decreased food intake in men but not in women (difference to placebo condition, men: −192.57 ± 78.48 kcal, P {\textless} 0.03; women: 18.54 ± 42.89 kcal, P {\textgreater} 0....},

abstract = {Under normal conditions, food intake and energy expenditure are balanced by a homeostatic system that maintains stability of body fat content over time. However, this homeostatic system can be overridden by the activation of 'emergency response circuits' that mediate feeding responses to emergent or stressful stimuli. Inhibition of these circuits is therefore permissive for normal energy homeostasis to occur, and their chronic activation can cause profound, even life-threatening, changes in body fat mass. This Review highlights how the interplay between homeostatic and emergency feeding circuits influences the biologically defended level of body weight under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {Hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) was administered to sleep-deprived (30-36 h) rhesus monkeys immediately preceding testing on a multi-image delayed match-to-sample (DMS) short-term memory task. The DMS task used multiple delays and stimulus images and effectively measures cognitive defects produced by sleep deprivation (Porrino et al., 2005). Two methods of administration of orexin-A were tested, intravenous injections (2.5-10.0 microg/kg, i.v.) and a novel method developed for nasal delivery via an atomizer spray mist to the nostrils (dose estimated 1.0 microg/kg). Results showed that orexin-A delivered via the intravenous and nasal routes significantly improved performance in sleep-deprived monkeys; however, the nasal delivery method was significantly more effective than the highest dose (10 microg/kg) of intravenous orexin-A tested. The improvement in performance by orexin-A was specific to trials classified as high versus low cognitive load as determined by performance difficulty under normal testing conditions. Except for the maximum intravenous dose (10 microg/kg), neither delivery method affected task performance in alert non-sleep-deprived animals. The improved performance in sleep-deprived animals was accompanied by orexin-A related alterations in local cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) in specific brain regions shown previously to be engaged by the task and impaired by sleep deprivation (Porrino et al., 2005). Consistent with the differential effects on performance, nasal delivered orexin-A produced a more pronounced reversal of sleep deprivation induced changes in brain metabolic activity (CMRglc) than intravenous orexin-A. These findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of intranasal orexin-A in alleviating cognitive deficits produced by loss of sleep.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is caused by a selective loss of hypocretin neurons and is associated with obesity. Ghrelin and leptin interact with hypocretin neurons to influence energy homeostasis. Here, we evaluated whether human hypocretin deficiency, or the narcolepsy therapeutic agent sodium oxybate, alter the levels of these hormones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eight male, medication free, hypocretin deficient, narcolepsy with cataplexy patients, and 8 healthy controls matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waisttohip ratio, and body fat percentage were assessed. Blood samples of total ghrelin and leptin were collected over 24 hours at 60 and 20-min intervals, respectively, during 2 study occasions: baseline, and during the last night of 5 consecutive nights of sodium oxybate administration (2 × 3.0 g/night).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At baseline, mean 24-h total ghrelin (936 ± 142 vs. 949 ± 175 pg/mL, p = 0.873) and leptin (115 ± 5.0 vs. 79.0 ± 32 mg/L, p = 0.18) levels were not different between hypocretin deficient narcolepsy patients and controls. Furthermore, sodium oxybate did not significantly affect the plasma concentration of either one of these hormones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The increased BMI of narcolepsy patients is unlikely to be mediated by hypocretin deficiency-mediated alterations in total ghrelin or leptin levels. Thus, the effects of these hormones on hypocretin neurons may be mainly unidirectional. Although sodium oxybate may influence body weight, the underlying mechanism is unlikely to involve changes in total ghrelin or leptin secretion.},

In this study, we note that hypocretin neuron perikarya in the human brain are localized to the perifornical region of the posterior hypothalamus, extending into the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons lightly innervate all areas of cerebral cortex studied in a variable pattern with denser innervation of association cortex than primary motor or sensory cortex. There is a dense innervation of hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, midline thalamus and nucleus of the diagonal band-nucleus basalis complex of the forebrain. This pattern of projections from the hypocretin neurons is compatible with an important role in arousal and the maintenance of the waking state.},

In order to determine the tissue-specific expression of the multiple human transcripts we have utilized specifically primed polymerase chain reactions (PCR) in combination with reverse-transcribed RNA. Using PCR analysis we determined that many human neuronal tissues express all 4 forms of human TH (hTH-1–4); however, hTH-3 and -4 are generally expressed at less than 1{\%} of the other two. Of all tissues examined, only pancreatic $\beta$-islet cells expressed a single form of human TH mRNA (hTH-2). The mRNA for rat TH is present in only one form, the equivalent of hTH-1. Since we have shown that the human genes for TH and insulin are only 2.7 kb apart and several groups have reported insulin-like expression in neuronal tissues, we looked for insulin transcription in the same central and peripheral nervous system samples. Insulin mRNA was not present within the limits of detection.},

Furthermore, microbiota transplantation studies in germ-free murine models showed that the efficient energy extraction traits of obese-type gut flora are transmissible. The proposed methods by which the microbiome may contribute to obesity include increasing dietary energy harvest, promoting fat deposition, and triggering systemic inflammation.

abstract = {Circadian rhythm is crucial for preventing hepatic insulin resistance, although the mechanism remains uncovered. Here we report that wake-active hypothalamic orexin system plays a key role in this regulation. Wild-type mice showed a daily rhythm in blood glucose levels peaked at awake period; however, the glucose rhythm was disappeared in orexin knockout mice despite normal feeding rhythm. Central administration of orexin A during nighttime awake period acutely elevated blood glucose levels but subsequently lowered daytime glucose levels in normal and diabetic db/db mice. The glucose-elevating and -lowering effects of orexin A were suppressed by adrenergic antagonists and hepatic parasympathectomy, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, including Pepck, were increased and decreased by orexin A at nanomolar and femtomolar doses, respectively. These results indicate that orexin can bidirectionally regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis via control of autonomic balance, leading to generation of the daily blood glucose oscillation. Furthermore, during aging, orexin deficiency enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver, and caused impairment of hepatic insulin signaling and abnormal gluconeogenic activity in pyruvate tolerance test. Collectively, the daily glucose rhythm under control of orexin appears to be important for maintaining ER homeostasis, thereby preventing insulin resistance in the liver.},

abstract = {In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and the POMC-derived peptide $\alpha$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ($\alpha$-MSH) promote satiety. POMC neurons receive orexin-A (OX-A)-expressing inputs and express both OX-A receptor type 1 (OX-1R) and cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) on the plasma membrane. OX-A is crucial for the control of wakefulness and energy homeostasis and promotes, in OX-1R-expressing cells, the biosynthesis of the endogenous counterpart of marijuana's psychotropic and appetite-inducing component $\Delta$(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, i.e., the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which acts at CB1R. We report that OX-A/OX-1R signaling at POMC neurons promotes 2-AG biosynthesis, hyperphagia, and weight gain by blunting $\alpha$-MSH production via CB1R-induced and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation- and STAT3 inhibition-mediated suppression of Pomc gene transcription. Because the systemic pharmacological blockade of OX-1R by SB334867 caused anorectic effects by reducing food intake and body weight, our results unravel a previously unsuspected role for OX-A in endocannabinoid-mediated promotion of appetite by combining OX-induced alertness with food seeking. Notably, increased OX-A trafficking was found in the fibers projecting to the ARC of obese mice (ob/ob and high-fat diet fed) concurrently with elevation of OX-A release in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of mice. Furthermore, a negative correlation between OX-A and $\alpha$-MSH serum levels was found in obese mice as well as in human obese subjects (body mass index {\textgreater} 40), in combination with elevation of alanine aminotransferase and $\gamma$-glutamyl transferase, two markers of fatty liver disease. These alterations were counteracted by antagonism of OX-1R, thus providing the basis for a therapeutic treatment of these diseases.},

abstract = {The quantitative contributions of pancreatic responsiveness and insulin sensitivity to glucose tolerance were measured using the "minimal modeling technique" in 18 lean and obese subjects (88-206{\%} ideal body wt). The individual contributions of insulin secretion and action were measured by interpreting the dynamics of plasma glucose and insulin during the intravenous glucose tolerance test in terms of two mathematical models. One, the insulin kinetics model, yields parameters of first-phase (phi 1) and second-phase (phi 2) responsivity of the beta-cells to glucose. The other glucose kinetics model yields the insulin sensitivity parameters, SI. Lean and obese subjects were subdivided into good (KG greater than 1.5) and lower (KG less than 1.5) glucose tolerance groups. The etiology of lower glucose tolerance was entirely different in lean and obese subjects. Lean, lower tolerance was related to pancreatic insufficiency (phi 2 77{\%} lower than in good tolerance controls [P less than 0.03]), but insulin sensitivity was normal (P greater than 0.5). In contrast, obese lower tolerance was entirely due to insulin resistance (SI diminished 60{\%} [P less than 0.01]); pancreatic responsiveness was not different from lean, good tolerance controls (phi 1: P greater than 0.06; phi 2: P greater than 0.40). Subjects (regardless of weight) could be segregated into good and lower tolerance by the product of second-phase beta-cell responsivity and insulin sensitivity (phi 2 . SI). Thus, these two factors were primarily responsible for overall determination of glucose tolerance. The effect of phi 1 was to modulate the KG value within those groups whose overall tolerance was determined by phi 2 . SI. This phi 1 modulating influence was more pronounced among insulin sensitive (phi 1 vs. KG, r = 0.79) than insulin resistant (obese, low tolerance; phi 1 vs. KG, r = 0.91) subjects. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the minimal model technique to determine the etiology of impaired glucose tolerance.},

We evaluated the acute effects of intranasal insulin on resting-state brain functional connectivity in older adults with T2DM. This proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of a single 40 IU dose of insulin or saline in 14 diabetic and 14 control subjects. Resting-state functional connectivity between the hippocampal region and default mode network (DMN) was quantified using functional MRI (fMRI) at 3Tesla. Following insulin administration, diabetic patients demonstrated increased resting-state connectivity between the hippocampal regions and the medial frontal cortex (MFC) as compared with placebo (cluster size: right, P = 0.03) and other DMN regions. On placebo, the diabetes group had lower connectivity between the hippocampal region and the MFC as compared with control subjects (cluster size: right, P = 0.02), but on insulin, MFC connectivity was similar to control subjects. Resting-state connectivity correlated with cognitive performance. A single dose of intranasal insulin increases resting-state functional connectivity between the hippocampal regions and multiple DMN regions in older adults with T2DM. Intranasal insulin administration may modify functional connectivity among brain regions regulating memory and complex cognitive behaviors.},

abstract = {Orexin deficiency results in narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, suggesting that the orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. However, orexin neurons are "multi-tasking" neurons that regulate sleep/wake states as well as feeding behavior, emotion, and reward processes. Orexin deficiency causes abnormalities in energy homeostasis, stress-related behavior, and reward systems. Orexin excites waking-active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem regions to maintain a long, consolidated waking period. Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic nuclei, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues suggests that these neurons have an important role as a link between energy homeostasis and vigilance states. The link between orexin and the ventral tegmental nucleus serves to motivate an animal to engage in goal-directed behavior. This review focuses on the interaction of orexin neurons with emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis systems. These connectivities are likely to be highly important to maintain proper vigilance states.},

abstract = {Emerging data demonstrate pivotal roles for brain insulin resistance and insulin deficiency as mediators of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) regulate neuronal survival, energy metabolism, and plasticity, which are required for learning and memory. Hence, endogenous brain-specific impairments in insulin and IGF signaling account for the majority of AD-associated abnormalities. However, a second major mechanism of cognitive impairment has been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Human and experimental animal studies revealed that neurodegeneration associated with peripheral insulin resistance is likely effectuated via a liver-brain axis whereby toxic lipids, including ceramides, cross the blood brain barrier and cause brain insulin resistance, oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and cell death. In essence, there are dual mechanisms of brain insulin resistance leading to AD-type neurodegeneration: one mediated by endogenous, CNS factors; and the other, peripheral insulin resistance with excess cytotoxic ceramide production.

Current goals were to determine: (1) whether sleep is different after consumption of a controlled diet vs. an ad libitum diet, and (2) whether dietary intake during ad libitum feeding is related to nocturnal sleep.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Randomized-crossover study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Inpatient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six normal weight men and women (30-45 years), habitually sleeping 7-9 h/night.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were studied for 5 nights under short (4 h in bed) or habitual (9 h in bed) sleep conditions. Only data from the habitual phase were used for the present analyses. During the first 4 days, participants consumed a controlled diet; on day 5, food intake was self-selected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Linear regression was used to determine relationships between daytime food intake and nighttime sleep on day 5. Sleep duration did not differ after 3 days of controlled feeding vs. a day of ad libitum intake. However, sleep after ad libitum eating had less slow wave sleep (SWS, p = 0.0430) and longer onset latency (p = 0.0085). Greater fiber intake predicted less stage 1 sleep (p = 0.0198) and more SWS (p = 0.0286). Percent of energy consumed as saturated fat predicted less SWS (p = 0.0422). A higher percent of energy from sugar and other carbohydrates not considered sugar or fiber was associated with arousals (p = 0.0320 and 0.0481, respectively).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Low fiber and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep with more arousals. Dietary changes could potentially be useful in the management of sleep disorders but this needs to be tested.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov {\#}NCT00935402.},

abstract = {AIMS: Hypoglycaemia during wakefulness increases hunger and food intake. Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus are at high risk of recurrent hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Given the background of frequent hypoglycaemic episodes during night-time sleep in diabetic patients, we investigated morning food intake after nocturnal hypoglycaemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We tested 16 healthy normal-weight subjects (eight women) on three nights. A linear fall in plasma glucose to a nadir of 2.2 mmol/l within 60 min was induced by insulin infusion immediately after sleep onset ('early hypo') or after about 3.5 h of sleep ('late hypo'). On a control night, no hypoglycaemia was induced. Spontaneous food intake at a breakfast buffet was registered on the subsequent morning.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared with the control condition (700 +/- 93 kcal), subjects ate more after 'late hypo' (867 +/- 108 kcal; P = 0.041), but not after 'early hypo' (852 +/- 111 kcal; P = 0.130). Analyses of macronutrient fractions revealed that in comparison with the control condition, subjects ate significantly more carbohydrates after both 'late hypo' (277 +/- 25 kcal vs. 206 +/- 23 kcal, P {\textless} 0.001) and 'early hypo' (245 +/- 23 kcal, P = 0.048), with this effect being more pronounced after late than early nocturnal hypoglycaemia (P = 0.026).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, nocturnal hypoglycaemia during sleep stimulates spontaneous food intake the following morning, with carbohydrate intake being especially affected. Effects were more pronounced after 'late hypo', suggesting the influence of temporal dynamics. Although healthy non-diabetic subjects were studied, similar mechanisms may contribute to the frequently observed body weight gain in insulin-treated diabetic patients.},

abstract = {Background: Recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased IgM and IgA responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. The aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the IgA and IgM responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (F{\&}S) symptoms of depression. Methods: We measured serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. The severity of F{\&}S symptoms was measured using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale. Results: The prevalences and median values of serum IgM and IgA against LPS of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. The IgM levels directed against the LPS of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression than in those without. The immune responses directed against LPS were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. There was a significant correlation between the IgA response directed against LPS and gastro-intestinal symptoms. Discussion: The results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the LPS of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. Bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of depression in some vulnerable individuals. The findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit IgA and IgM responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Orexins were originally thought to specifically mediate feeding and promote wakefulness, but it is now clear that they participate in a wide range of behavioral and physiological processes under select circumstances. Orexins primarily mediate behavior under situations of high motivational relevance, such as during physiological need states, exposure to threats or reward opportunities. We hypothesize that many behavioral functions of orexins (including regulation of sleep/wake cycling) reflect a fundamentally integrated function for orexins in translating motivational activation into organized suites of psychological and physiological processes supporting adaptive behaviors. We also discuss how numerous forms of neural heterogeneity modulate this function, allowing orexin neurons to organize diverse, adaptive responses in a variety of motivationally relevant situations. Thus, the involvement of orexins in diverse behaviors may reflect a common underlying function for this peptide system.},

In the current study we have compared the effects of treadmill running, to yard play on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Hcrt level in normal dogs. We find that treadmill locomotion, at a wide range of speeds, does not increase Hcrt level beyond baseline, whereas yard play produces a substantial increase in Hcrt, even though both activities produce comparable increases in heart rate, respiration and body temperature. We conclude that motor and cardiovascular changes are not sufficient to elevate CSF levels of Hcrt and we hypothesize that the emotional aspects of yard play account for the observed increase in Hcrt.},

abstract = {The {\&}lt;1 Hz EEG slow oscillation (SO) is a hallmark of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and is critically involved in sleep-associated memory formation. Previous studies showed that SOs and associated memory function can be effectively enhanced by closed-loop auditory stimulation, when clicks are presented in synchrony with upcoming SO up states. However, increasing SOs and synchronized excitability also bear the risk of emerging seizure activity, suggesting the presence of mechanisms in the healthy brain that counter developing hypersynchronicity during SOs. Here, we aimed to test the limits of driving SOs through closed-loop auditory stimulation in healthy humans. Study I tested a “Driving stimulation” protocol (vs “Sham”) in which trains of clicks were presented in synchrony with SO up states basically as long as an ongoing SO train was identified on-line. Study II compared Driving stimulation with a “2-Click” protocol where the maximum of stimuli delivered in a train was limited to two clicks. Stimulation was applied during SWS in the first 210 min of nocturnal sleep. Before and after sleep declarative word-pair memories were tested. Compared with the Sham control, Driving stimulation prolonged SO trains and enhanced SO amplitudes, phase-locked spindle activity, and overnight retention of word pairs (all ps {\&}lt; 0.05). Importantly, effects of Driving stimulation did not exceed those of 2-Click stimulation (p {\&}gt; 0.180), indicating the presence of a mechanism preventing the development of hypersynchronicity during SO activity. Assessment of temporal dynamics revealed a rapidly fading phase-locked spindle activity during repetitive click stimulation, suggesting that spindle refractoriness contributes to this protective mechanism.},

abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin may increase social cohesion by making us more willing to trust others and/or to conform to their opinions. Here we investigated whether intranasal oxytocin can influence acceptance of advice given on solving everyday social problems by either individual expert (psychologist) or non-expert advisors with or without influencing their perceived likeability or trustworthiness. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo-control design study in 160 male and female subjects, intranasal oxytocin (24IU) only significantly enhanced acceptance of advice given by female psychologists who were rated as the most trustworthy advisors. However, oxytocin itself did not alter either trustworthiness or likeability ratings. The oxytocin effect on acceptance of the female psychologist's advice was not maintained after a week, with subjects mainly reverting to their original solutions. These findings suggest that while oxytocin can transiently increase acceptance of advice from the most trustworthy individuals this is because it makes subjects more likely to conform to their opinions rather than enhancing their perceived trustworthiness or likeability. Thus in every day contexts oxytocin may primarily promote social cohesion by facilitating conformity towards the opinions of the most trusted individuals.},

The effect of the high dose of orexin-A (1 ??g/rat) was eliminated by pretreatment with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist. In contrast, the effect of the low dose of orexin-A (10 ng/rat) was suppressed by thioperamide maleate salt, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist. Moreover, icv administration of 1 ??g/rat and 10 ng/rat of orexin-A increased and decreased the levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), respectively. The effect of 1 ??g/rat of orexin-A on plasma FFA was eliminated by propranolol hydrochloride, a ??-adrenergic receptor blocker, and also by diphenhydramine. The effect of orexin-A at dose of 10 ng/rat disappeared by pretreatment with atropine sulfate, a muscarinic receptor blocker, and thioperamide maleate salt. Our results suggest that high doses of orexin-A may regulate the lipolytic processes in adipose tissue through facilitation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is driven by histamine neurons through the H1 receptor, and that the ??3-receptor may be involved in this enhanced lipolytic response. Low doses of orexin-A, on the other hand, may lower lipolysis by suppressing sympathetic nerve activity via the H3-receptor, and the muscarinic receptor may be related to this response. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Insulin acts in the central nervous system to reduce food intake and body weight  and is considered a major adiposity signal. After intranasal administration, insulin enters the cerebrospinal fluid compartment and alters brain functions in the absence of substantial absorption into the blood stream. Here we report the effects of 8 weeks of intranasal administration of insulin (4 x 40 IU/day) or placebo to two groups of healthy human subjects (12 men and 8 women in each group). The insulin-treated men lost 1.28 kg body wt and 1.38 kg of body fat, and their waist circumference decreased by 1.63 cm. Plasma leptin levels dropped by an average of 27{\%}. In contrast, the insulin-treated women did not lose body fat and gained 1.04 kg body wt due to a rise in extracellular water. Our results provide a strong, first confirmation in humans that insulin acts as a negative feedback signal in the regulation of adiposity and point to a differential sensitivity to the catabolic effects of insulin based on sex.},

abstract = {The early-morning increase in insulin requirements of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has been referred to as the "dawn phenomenon." To determine the roles of growth hormone levels and sympathoadrenal activity in this phenomenon, we studied six subjects with IDDM on four occasions during a constant overnight infusion of insulin. In control experiments (infusion of insulin alone), plasma glucose increased from 98 +/- 5 mg per deciliter at midnight to 225 +/- 36 at 8:00 a.m. (P less than 0.001), glucose production increased by 65 per cent (P less than 0.001), and glucose clearance decreased by 50 per cent (P less than 0.001). When nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion were prevented by infusion of somatostatin plus replacement glucagon, neither plasma glucose levels nor glucose production increased significantly, and glucose clearance did not decrease. When nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion were simulated by hourly intravenous injections of growth hormone (15 to 100 micrograms) during infusion of somatostatin and glucagon, plasma glucose levels and glucose production increased and glucose clearance decreased to values observed in control experiments. During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine and propranolol), values for plasma glucose, glucose production, and glucose utilization were not significantly different from those in control experiments. Increases in plasma glucose were significantly correlated with peak plasma growth hormone concentrations (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01). We conclude that nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion are primarily responsible for the dawn phenomenon in patients with IDDM.},

abstract = {Experiments in animals suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin acts as an anorexigenic signal in the central nervous control of food intake. In humans, however, research has almost exclusively focused on the involvement of oxytocin in the regulation of social behavior. We investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on ingestion and metabolic function in healthy men. Food intake in the fasted state was examined 45 min after neuropeptide administration, followed by the assessment of olfaction and reward-driven snack intake in the absence of hunger. Energy expenditure was registered by indirect calorimetry, and blood was repeatedly sampled to determine concentrations of blood glucose and hormones. Oxytocin markedly reduced snack consumption, restraining, in particular, the intake of chocolate cookies by 25{\%}. Oxytocin, moreover, attenuated basal and postprandial levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and curbed the meal-related rise in plasma glucose. Energy expenditure and hunger-driven food intake as well as olfactory function were not affected. Our results indicate that oxytocin, beyond its role in social bonding, regulates nonhomeostatic, reward-related energy intake, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and the glucoregulatory response to food intake in humans. These effects can be assumed to converge with the psychosocial function of oxytocin and imply possible applications in the treatment of metabolic disorders.},

Food reward requires stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons and is modulated by central leptin action, but the exact central mechanisms remain unclear. Stimulatory and inhibitory leptin actions on dopamine neurons have been reported, e.g. by indirect actions on orexin neurons or via direct innervation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Methods: We showed earlier that LepRb neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) co-express the inhibitory acting neuropeptide galanin (GAL-LepRb neurons). We studied the involvement of GAL-LepRb neurons to regulate nutrient reward in mice with selective LepRb deletion from galanin neurons (GAL-LepRbKO mice). Results: We found that the rewarding value and preference for sucrose over fat was increased in GAL-LepRbKO mice compared to controls. LHA GAL-LepRb neurons innervate orexin neurons, but not the VTA. Further, expression of galanin and its receptor GalR1 are decreased in the LHA of GAL-LepRbKO mice, resulting in increased activation of orexin neurons. Conclusion: We suggest galanin as an important mediator of leptin action to modulate nutrient reward by inhibiting orexin neurons.},

This review summarizes the role of hypocretins in modulating non-sleep-related energy expenditure with specific focus on the augmentation of whole body energy expenditure as well as hypocretin-induced physical activity and sympathetic outflow. We compare the efficacy of hypocretin-1 and 2 on energy expenditure and evaluate whether the literature implicates hypocretin signalling though the hypocretin-1 and -2 receptor as having shared and or functionally specific physiological effects. Thus far data suggest that hypocretin-1 has a more robust stimulatory effect relative to hypocretin-2. Furthermore, hypocretin-1 receptor predominantly mediates behaviours known to influence energy expenditure. Further studies on the hypocretin-2 receptor are needed.},

abstract = {Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method for assessing {\{}beta{\}}-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations. It has been reported in {\textgreater}500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation of IR than {\{}beta{\}}-cell function. This article summarizes the physiological basis of HOMA, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Decreases in {\{}beta{\}}-cell function were modeled by changing the {\{}beta{\}}-cell response to plasma glucose concentrations. The original HOMA model was described in 1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae. HOMA has been validated against a variety of physiological methods. We review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and give guidance on its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and inappropriate use (e.g., measuring {\{}beta{\}}-cell function in isolation). The HOMA model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose. In conclusion, the HOMA model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data. However, as with all models, the primary input data need to be robust, and the data need to be interpreted carefully.},

abstract = {Insulin and its signaling systems are implicated in both central and peripheral mechanisms governing the ingestion, distribution, metabolism, and storage of nutrients in organisms ranging from worms to humans. Input from the environment regarding the availability and type of nutrients is sensed and integrated with humoral information (provided in part by insulin) regarding the sufficiency of body fat stores. In response to these afferent inputs, neuronal pathways are activated that influence energy flux and nutrient metabolism in the body and ensure reproductive competency. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that reduced central nervous system insulin signaling from either defective secretion or action contributes to the pathogenesis of common metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity, and may therefore help to explain the close association between these two disorders. These considerations implicate insulin action in the brain, an organ previously considered to be insulin independent, as a key determinant of both glucose and energy homeostasis.},

By contrast, the diagnostic significance of low CSF hypocretin-1 is unclear in the presence of acute CNS inflammation or trauma. The clinical usefulness of CSF testing in hypersomnia that is symptomatic of a neurological disorder remains to be evaluated. Determination of CSF hypocretin-1 concentration to diagnose narcolepsy might be most useful in ambulatory patients with cataplexy but with a normal multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) result, or if MSLT is not interpretable, conclusive, or feasible. Because 98{\%} of patients with hypocretin-1 deficiency are positive for HLA DQB1*0602, we suggest that HLA typing is a useful screen before lumbar puncture.

Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine a cutoff point for identifying insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies performed at 120 mU/m(2){\textperiodcentered}min in a white population and to generate equations from routinely measured clinic and blood variables for predicting clamp-derived glucose disposal rate (GDR), i.e., insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assembled data from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (120 mU/m(2){\textperiodcentered}min insulin dose) performed at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center between 2001 and 2011. Subjects were divided into subjects with diabetes (n = 51) and subjects without diabetes (n = 116) by self-report and/or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL. RESULTS: We found that 75{\%} of individuals with a GDR {\textless}5.6 mg/kg fat-free mass (FFM) + 17.7{\textperiodcentered}min were truly insulin resistant. Cutoff values for GDRs normalized for body weight, body surface area, or FFM were 4.9 mg/kg{\textperiodcentered}min, 212.2 mg/m(2){\textperiodcentered}min, and 7.3 mg/kgFFM{\textperiodcentered}min, respectively. Next, we used classification tree models to predict GDR from routinely measured clinical and biochemical variables. We found that individual insulin resistance could be estimated with good sensitivity (89{\%}) and specificity (67{\%}) from the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) {\textgreater}5.9 or 2.8{\textless} HOMA-IR {\textless}5.9 with HDL {\textless}51 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a cutoff for defining insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Moreover, we now provide classification trees for predicting insulin resistance from routinely measured clinical and biochemical markers. These findings extend the clamp from a research tool to providing a clinically meaningful message for participants in research studies, potentially providing greater opportunity for earlier recognition of insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is a common condition, recognized to be a central feature of the metabolic syndrome, and strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The quantitative assessment of insulin sensitivity is not used for routine clinical purposes, but the emerging importance of insulin resistance has led to its wider application to research studies that have examined its pathogenesis, aetiology and consequences. The gold standard method for the determination of insulin sensitivity is the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp from which indices of insulin sensitivity can be derived. The clamp technique is both expensive and complex to undertake and has prompted the use of surrogate methods, notably the insulin tolerance test and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Indices may be derived from these methods and correlate well with those derived from clamp studies. Indices can also be derived from measurements made during a standard oral glucose tolerance test and from one-off fasting specimens (e.g. homeostasis model assessment and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index). These indices lend themselves for use in large population studies where a relatively simple, inexpensive assessment is necessary. However, these tests all suffer from important limitations, including poor precision. Insulin resistance is increasingly being assessed in clinical situations, where relatively simple markers are required. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 is an emerging marker which may be useful in this context.},

abstract = {Circulating insulin is thought to provide a major feedback signal for the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and food intake, although this signaling appears to be slowed by a time-consuming blood-to-brain transport. Here we show, by recording direct current potentials, a rapid onset of the effects of circulating insulin on human brain activity. Recordings were obtained from 27 men who were intravenously injected with insulin (0.1 mU/kg body wt as bolus) and placebo. In a euglycemic condition, hypoglycemia was prevented, while in the hypoglycemic condition, plasma glucose reached a postinjection nadir of 43 mg/dl. Insulin injection induced a marked negative direct current (DC) potential shift starting within 7 min in all subjects. With euglycemic conditions, the DC potential at 10-60 min postinsulin injection averaged -621.3 microV (compared with preinjection baseline). Hypoglycemia reduced this potential to an average of -331.2 microV. While insulin per se did not affect oscillatory electroencephalographic activity, hypoglycemia peaking 25 min after insulin injection was accompanied by an immediate increase in theta activity. The rapid emergence of the DC potential shift, reflecting gross ionic changes in brain tissues, indicates that systemic insulin can serve as an immediate feedback signal in the control of hypothalamic and higher brain functions.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Epidemiological data indicate that reduced sleep duration is associated with increased incidence of type-2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that, when part of a Western-like lifestyle, recurrent bedtime restriction may result in decreased glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion and action. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a randomized crossover study at a university clinical research center and sleep research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthy volunteers (five females and six males) with a mean (+/-sd) age of 39 +/- 5 yr and body mass index of 26.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2) participated in the study. INTERVENTION: The study included two 14-d periods of controlled exposure to sedentary living with ad libitum food intake and 5.5- or 8.5-h bedtimes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oral and iv glucose challenges were used to obtain measures of glucose tolerance, glucose effectiveness, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity at the end of each intervention. Secondary measures included circulating concentrations of the glucose counter-regulatory hormones, cortisol, GH, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. RESULTS: Bedtime restriction reduced daily sleep by 122 +/- 25 min. Both study periods were associated with comparable weight gain; however, recurrent sleep restriction resulted in reduced oral glucose tolerance (2-h glucose value, 144 +/- 25 vs. 132 +/- 36 mg/dl; P {\textless} 0.01) and insulin sensitivity [3.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.0 +/- 1.6 (mU/liter)(-1) x min(-1); P {\textless} 0.03], and increased glucose effectiveness (0.023 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.020 +/- 0.005 min(-1); P {\textless} 0.04). Although 24-h cortisol and GH concentrations did not change, there was a modest increase in 24-h epinephrine and nighttime norepinephrine levels during the 5.5-h bedtime condition. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental bedtime restriction, designed to approximate the short sleep times experienced by many individuals in Westernized societies, may facilitate the development of insulin resistance and reduced glucose tolerance.},

The hypocretin (Hcrt) protein products are restricted to neuronal cell bodies of the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas. The fibers of these neurons are widespread throughout the posterior hypothalamus and project to multiple targets in other areas, including brainstem and thalamus. Hcrt immunoreactivity is associated with large granular vesicles at synapses. One of the Hcrt peptides was excitatory when applied to cultured, synaptically coupled hypothalamic neurons, but not hippocampal neurons.

abstract = {Insulin and its receptor are found throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Insulin administered into the CNS can exert powerful effects, yet the consensus is that little or no insulin is produced in the CNS. Therefore, CNS insulin is essentially dependent on the ability of peripheral insulin to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Insulin is known to cross the BBB by a saturable transport mechanism. This transporter shows some thematic similarities to other transporters for peptides or regulatory proteins. It is unevenly distributed throughout the CNS with the olfactory bulbs having the fastest transport rate of any brain region. It is partially saturated at euglycemic levels, suggesting that its main signaling function occurs at physiological blood levels, rather than as a brake to hypoglycemic events. One probable function of the BBB transporter is to allow CNS insulin to act as a counter-regulatory hormone to peripheral insulin. The transporter is regulated, with the transport rate of insulin being altered during development and by fasting, obesity, hibernation, diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. Enhancement of insulin transport by lipopolysaccharide could be the basis for the insulin resistance seen with bacterial infections. Inhibition of insulin transport across the BBB by dexamethasone could be the basis for the enhanced appetite seen with glucocorticoid treatments. Insulin itself also has effects on the BBB, altering enzymatic and transporter functions. Overall, BBB transport of insulin provides a mechanism for peripheral insulin to act within the CNS as a regulatory peptide.},

abstract = {The novel neuropeptides called hypocretins (orexins) have recently been identified as being localized exclusively in cell bodies in a subregion of the tuberal part of the hypothalamus. The structure of the hypocretins, their accumulation in vesicles of axon terminals, and their excitatory effect on cultured hypothalamic neurons suggest that the hypocretins function in intercellular communication. To characterize these peptides further and to help understand what physiological functions they may serve, we undertook an immunohistochemical study to examine the distribution of preprohypocretin-immunoreactive neurons and fibers in the rat brain. Preprohypocretin-positive neurons were found in the perifornical nucleus and in the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas. These cells were distinct from those that express melanin-concentrating hormone. Although they represent a restricted group of cells, their projections were widely distributed in the brain. We observed labeled fibers throughout the hypothalamus. The densest extrahypothalamic projection was found in the locus coeruleus. Fibers were also seen in the septal nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the paraventricular and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus, the zona incerta, the subthalamic nucleus, the central gray, the substantia nigra, the raphe nuclei, the parabrachial area, the medullary reticular formation, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Less prominent projections were found in cortical regions, central and anterior amygdaloid nuclei, and the olfactory bulb. These results suggest that hypocretins are likely to have a role in physiological functions in addition to food intake such as regulation of blood pressure, the neuroendocrine system, body temperature, and the sleep-waking cycle.},

abstract = {Measuring insulin sensitivity in the presence of physiological changes in glucose and insulin concentrations, e.g., during a meal or OGTT, is important to better understand insulin resistance in a variety of metabolic conditions. Recently, two oral minimal models have been proposed to measure overall insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and its selective effect on glucose disposal (S(I)*) from oral tests. S(I) and S(I)* have been successfully validated against multiple tracer meal estimates, but validation against euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp estimates is lacking. Here, we do so in 21 subjects who underwent both a multiple-tracer OGTT and a labeled euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Correlation between minimal-model S(I), S(I) and corresponding clamp estimates S(I)(*clamp), S(I)(*clamp) was satisfactory, respectively r = 0.81, P {\textless} 0.001, and r = 0.71, P {\textless} 0.001. S(I) was significantly lower than S(I)(clamp) (8.08 +/- 0.89 vs. 13.66 +/- 1.69 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.0002), whereas S(I) and S(I)(*clamp) were very similar (8.17 +/- 1.59 vs. 8.84 +/- 1.39 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.52). These results add credibility to the oral minimal-model method as a simple and reliable physiological tool to estimate S(I) and S(I)*, also in large-scale clinical trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Recent epidemiological studies suggest that short sleep duration may be associated with the development of obesity from childhood to adulthood. OBJECTIVES:: To assess whether the evidence supports the presence of a relationship between short sleep duration and obesity at different ages, and to obtain an estimate of the risk. METHODS:: We performed a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1996-2007 wk 40), EMBASE (from 1988), AMED (from 1985), CINHAL (from 1982) and PsycINFO (from 1985) and manual searches without language restrictions. When necessary, authors were contacted. Criteria for inclusion were: report of duration of sleep as exposure, BMI as continuous outcome and prevalence of obesity as categorical outcome, number of participants, age, and gender. Results were pooled using a random effect model. Sensitivity analysis was performed, heterogeneity and publication bias were also checked. Results are expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR [95{\%} confidence intervals, CIs]) and as pooled regression coefficients ($\beta$; 95{\%} CIs). RESULTS:: Of 696 studies identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria (19 in children and 26 in adults) and 30 (12 and 18, respectively) were pooled in the meta-analysis for a total of 36 population samples. They included 634,511 participants (30,002 children and 604,509 adults) from around the world. Age ranged from 2 to 102 years and included boys, girls, men and women. In children the pooled OR for short duration of sleep and obesity was 1.89 (1.46 to 2.43; P {\textless} 0.0001). In adults the pooled OR was 1.55 (1.43 to 1.68; P {\textless} 0.0001). There was no evidence of publication bias. In adults, the pooled $\beta$ for short sleep duration was −0.35 (−0.57 to −0.12) unit change in BMI per hour of sleep change. CONCLUSIONS:: Cross-sectional studies from around the world show a consistent increased risk of obesity amongst short sleepers in children and adults. Causal inference is difficult due to lack of control for important confounders and inconsistent evidence of temporal sequence in prospective studies.

The hypocretin system is influenced both neuronally (e.g. suprachiasmatic nucleus, GABAergic, cholinergic and aminergic brainstem nuclei) as well as metabolically (e.g. glucose, ghrelin, and leptin). Physiologically the hypocretin system has been implicated in the regulation of behaviours that are associated with wakefulness, locomotion, and feeding. A role in REM sleep, neuroendocrine, autonomic and metabolic functions has also been suggested. Pathophysiologically a deficient hypocretin neurotransmission has been found in human narcolepsy and (engineered) animal models of the disorder. Different mechanisms are involved including (1) degeneration of hypocretin neurons (mice), (2) hypocretin ligand deficiency (humans, mice, dogs), (3) hypocretin receptor deficiency (mice, dogs). Reports of low hypocretin-1 cerebrospinal fluid levels in neurologic conditions (e.g. Guillain-Barr?? syndrome, traumatic brain injury, hypothalamic lesions) with and without sleep-wake disturbances and, on the other hand, observations of normal levels in about 11{\%} of narcoleptics raise questions about the exact nature and pathophysiological base of the link between hypocretin deficiency and clinical manifestations in human narcolepsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A gain in body weight is a common adverse effect of glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms of which are not completely understood. Blood glucose is considered to play a crucial role in the regulation of food intake. On this background, we hypothesized that a short-term reduction of blood glucose concentration to normal values acutely increases food intake in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To test this hypothesis, 12 patients with type 2 diabetes were examined twice, once during a euglycemic (5.0 mmol/l) clamp experiment and another time during a hyperglycemic (10.5 mmol/l) clamp. The experiments were performed in a single-blind fashion with the order of conditions balanced across patients. On both clamp conditions, insulin was infused at a constant rate of 2.5 mU/kg per min for 125 min. Simultaneously, a glucose solution was infused at a variable rate to achieve target glycemic levels. During the final 30 min of the clamps, the patients were allowed to eat as much as they liked from a standard breakfast buffet. RESULTS Compared with the hyperglycemic condition, the patients ingested on average 25 +/- 10{\%} more energy during euglycemia (645 +/- 75 vs. 483 +/- 37 kcal; P = 0.029). The increased energy intake during euglycemia was equally distributed across macronutrient components, i.e., during euglycemia the patients ate more carbohydrates (+27.1 +/- 11.4{\%}; P = 0.037), fat (+22.5 +/- 10.0{\%}; P = 0.046), and proteins (+25.2 +/- 11.2{\%}; P = 0.046) than during hyperglycemia. Circulating levels of insulin, amylin, leptin, ghrelin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 did not differ between the euglycemic and hyperglycemia clamp, excluding a major contribution of these hormones to the difference in food intake. Summing up the glucose administered intravenously and the food ingested yielded a remarkably similar total energy influx in both conditions (794 +/- 64 vs. 790 +/- 53 kcal; P = 0.961). CONCLUSIONS Together our data suggest that total energy supply to the organism is tightly regulated on a short-term basis independent of the route of influx. Alternatively, it can be hypothesized that euglycemia stimulated or that hyperglycemia suppressed food intake at the subsequent buffet meal in our type 2 diabetic patients. Regardless of these different interpretations, our data indicate an important regulatory role of glucose for food intake in type 2 diabetic patients that is of considerable clinical relevance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation is associated with increased risk of adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is uncertain whether sleep deprivation and/or altered sleep architecture affects glycemic regulation or insulin sensitivity or secretion. We hypothesized that in obese adolescents, sleep disturbances would associate with altered glucose and insulin homeostasis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study of 62 obese adolescents took place at the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Sleep Laboratory in a tertiary care children's hospital. Subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometric measurements, overnight polysomnography, and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and serial insulin and glucose levels were obtained, indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated, and sleep architecture was assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the association of total sleep and sleep stages with measures of insulin and glucose homeostasis, adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: We found significant U-shaped (quadratic) associations between sleep duration and both HbA(1c) and serial glucose levels on OGTT and positive associations between slow-wave sleep (N3) duration and insulin secretory measures, independent of degree of obesity, pubertal stage, sex, and obstructive sleep apnea measures. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient and excessive sleep was associated with short-term and long-term hyperglycemia in our obese adolescents. Decreased N3 was associated with decreased insulin secretion. These effects may be related, with reduced insulin secretory capacity leading to hyperglycemia. We speculate that optimizing sleep may stave off the development of T2DM in obese adolescents.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the circadian variation of plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and urine output in patients with severe nocturia ({\textgreater} three times per night) and to assess the effect of oral desmopressin on nocturnal urine output in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with severe nocturia and five age-matched controls without were assessed over 24 h (circadian sampling) during a 72-h hospital admission. Blood levels of ADH and changes of urine output were measured in the patients before and after the oral administration of desmopressin (0.2 mg, at 22.00 hours in the second day), and in the controls not treated with desmopressin. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control, the patients had no diurnal variation in urine output and greater nocturnal urine production, associated with a lack of nocturnal increase in ADH level. Compared with the baseline urine output, desmopressin significantly decreased night-time (23.00-08.00 hour) urine output in the patients (P {\textless} 0.05). Desmopressin significantly increased the osmolality of night-time urine (P {\textless} 0.05), and there was no systemic adverse reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Severe nocturia in a large proportion of elderly men with lower urinary tract symptoms is caused by nocturnal polyuria and natriuresis, because they have no nocturnal increase in ADH. These results suggest that desmopressin may be effective in decreasing nocturnal urine production in patients with severe nocturia who do not respond to conventional treatment.},

abstract = {Research in animals and humans has associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) with decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of insulin in combination with decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) in the brain. This phenomenon is accompanied by attenuated receptor expression of insulin and insulin-like growth factor, enhanced serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and impaired transport of insulin across the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal insulin improves both memory performance and metabolic integrity of the brain in patients suffering from AD or its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment. These results, in conjunction with the finding that insulin mitigates hippocampal synapse vulnerability to beta amyloid, a peptide thought to be causative in the development of AD, provide a strong rationale for hypothesizing that pharmacological strategies bolstering brain insulin signaling, such as intranasal administration of insulin, could have significant potential in the treatment and prevention of AD. With this view in mind, the review at hand will present molecular mechanisms potentially underlying the memory-enhancing and neuroprotective effects of intranasal insulin. Then, we will discuss the results of intranasal insulin studies that have demonstrated that enhancing brain insulin signaling improves memory and learning processes in both cognitively healthy and impaired humans. Finally, we will provide an overview of neuroimaging studies indicating that disturbances in insulin metabolism-such as insulin resistance in obesity, type 2 diabetes and AD-and altered brain responses to insulin are linked to decreased cerebral volume and especially to hippocampal atrophy.},

This study investigated the effect of macronutrient composition on spontaneous eating behaviour. On four separate occasions, 16 fasted, healthy, non-obese men, blinded to the true purpose of the study, consumed iso-energetic (???3MJ) yoghurt-based pre-loads of equivalent weight (???0.5 kg), high in fat (40{\%}) [HF], carbohydrate (60{\%}) [HC] or protein (29{\%}) [HP], and no pre-load in a randomized, single-blind fashion. Subjects ate at will from a selection of food items for the remainder of the day (7 h) with the time of food requests (h) and energy content (kJ) and macronutrient distribution ({\%}) of food eaten recorded. The three pre-loads delayed the first spontaneous request for food by 1.5-1.8 h relative to no pre-load. Total spontaneous food intake was suppressed 29{\%} [HP], 20{\%} [HF] and 17{\%} [HC] by the pre-loads. Neither the amount of food eaten per spontaneous eating episode, nor the spontaneous eating frequency differed statistically following ingestion of the different pre-loads or no pre-load. In this study, in subjects who were free to choose when as well as how much they ate, a high-protein pre-load exerted similar effects on satiety as did iso-energetic high-fat and high-carbohydrate pre-loads. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Narcolepsy, a neurological disorder affecting 1 in 2000 individuals, is associated with HLA-DQB1*0602 and low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) levels. OBJECTIVES: To delineate the spectrum of the hypocretin deficiency syndrome and to establish CSF hypocretin-1 measurements as a diagnostic tool for narcolepsy. DESIGN: Diagnosis, HLA-DQ, clinical data, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and CSF hypocretin-1 were studied in a case series of patients with sleep disorders from 1999 to 2002. Signal detection analysis was used to determine the CSF hypocretin-1 levels best predictive for International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)-defined narcolepsy (blinded criterion standard). Clinical and demographic features were compared in narcoleptic subjects with and without low CSF hypocretin-1 levels. SETTING: Sleep disorder and neurology clinics in the United States and Europe, with biological testing performed at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif. PARTICIPANTS: There were 274 patients with narcolepsy; hypersomnia; obstructive sleep apnea; restless legs syndrome; insomnia; and atypical hypersomnia cases such as familial cases, narcolepsy without cataplexy or without HLA-DQB1*0602, recurrent hypersomnias, and symptomatic cases (eg, Parkinson disease, depression, Prader-Willi syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease type C). The subject group also included 296 controls (healthy and with neurological disorders). INTERVENTION: Venopuncture for HLA typing, lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, primary diagnosis using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Stanford Sleep Inventory for evaluation of narcolepsy, and sleep recording studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic threshold for CSF hypocretin-1, HLA-DQB1*0602 positivity, and clinical and polysomnographic features. RESULTS: HLA-DQB1*0602 frequency was increased in narcolepsy with typical cataplexy (93{\%} vs 17{\%} in controls), narcolepsy without cataplexy (56{\%}), and in essential hypersomnia (52{\%}). Hypocretin-1 levels below 110 pg/mL were diagnostic for narcolepsy. Values above 200 pg/mL were considered normal. Most subjects with low levels were HLA-DQB1*0602-positive narcolepsy-cataplexy patients. These patients did not always have abnormal MSLT. Rare subjects without cataplexy, DQB1*0602, and/or with secondary narcolepsy had low levels. Ten subjects with hypersomnia had intermediate levels, 7 with narcolepsy (often HLA negative, of secondary nature, and/or with atypical cataplexy or no cataplexy), and 1 with periodic hypersomnia. Healthy controls and subjects with other sleep disorders all had normal levels. Neurological subjects had generally normal levels (n = 194). Intermediate (n = 30) and low (n = 3) levels were observed in various acute neuropathologic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Narcolepsy-cataplexy with hypocretin deficiency is a genuine disease entity. Measuring CSF hypocretin-1 is a definitive diagnostic test, provided that it is interpreted within the clinical context. It may be most useful in cases with cataplexy and when the MSLT is difficult to interpret (ie, in subjects already treated with psychoactive drugs or with other concurrent sleep disorders).},

Despite (or because of) its simplicity it continues to be used today - both as a clinical tool and an approach to understanding the composite effects of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity on glucose tolerance and risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The original assumptions of the model have led to an understanding of the kinetics of insulin in vivo, as well as the relative importance of beta-cell compensatory failure in the pathogenesis of diabetes. The disposition index (DI), a parameter emerging from the model, represents the ability of the pancreatic islets to compensate for insulin resistance. There is evidence that a locus on chromosome 11 codes for the DI, which has a significant heritability and can predict type 2 diabetes better than any known genetic locus. Even today, the model continues to be a subject of scientific discovery and discourse.},

However, it is unknown whether this effect is paralleled by an improved sleep-dependent consolidation of memory.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: This double-blind within-subject crossover study tested sensitivity of overnight retention of declarative neutral and emotional materials (word pairs, pictures) as well as a procedural memory task (sequence finger tapping) to oral administration of placebo or 10 mg tiagabine (at 22:30).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Fourteen healthy young men aged 21.9 years (range 18-28 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Tiagabine significantly increased the time spent in SWS and decreased REM sleep compared to placebo. Tiagabine also enhanced slow wave activity (0.5-4.0 Hz) and density of {\textless} 1 Hz slow oscillations during NREM sleep. Fast (12-15 Hz) and slow (9-12 Hz) spindle activity, in particular that occurring phase-locked to the slow oscillation cycle, was decreased following tiagabine. Despite signs of deeper and more SWS, overnight retention of memory tested after sleep the next evening (19:30) was generally not improved after tiagabine, but on average even lower than after placebo, with this impairing effect reaching significance for procedural sequence finger tapping.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show that increasing slow wave sleep with tiagabine does not improve memory consolidation. Possibly this is due to functional differences from normal slow wave sleep, i.e., the concurrent suppressive influence of tiagabine on phase-locked spindle activity.},

We hypothesized that the hormone contributes to the postprandial regulation of appetite for palatable food, and assessed the effects on appetite and snack intake of postprandial versus fasted intranasal insulin administration to the brain in healthy women. Two groups of subjects were intranasally administered 160 IU insulin or vehicle after lunch. Two hours later, consumption of cookies of varying palatability was measured under the pretext of a taste test. In a control study, the effects of intranasal insulin administered to fasted female subjects were assessed. Compared with placebo, insulin administration in the postprandial but not in the fasted state decreased appetite as well as intake and rated palatability of chocolate chip cookies (the most palatable snack offered). In both experiments, intranasal insulin induced a slight decrease in plasma glucose but did not affect serum insulin concentrations. Data indicate that brain insulin acts as a relevant satiety signal during the postprandial period, in particular reducing the intake of highly palatable food, and impacts peripheral glucose homeostasis. Postprandial intranasal insulin administration might be useful in curtailing overconsumption of snacks with accentuated rewarding value.},

abstract = {Both reduction in total sleep duration with slow-wave sleep (SWS) largely preserved and alterations of sleep quality (especially marked reduction of SWS) with preservation of total sleep duration are associated with insulin resistance without compensatory increase in insulin secretion, resulting in impaired glucose tolerance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. When performed under rigorously controlled conditions of energy intake and physical activity, sleep restriction is also associated with a decrease in circulating levels of leptin (an anorexigenic hormone) and an increase in circulating levels of ghrelin (an orexigenic hormone), hunger and appetite. Furthermore, sleep restriction is also associated with a stimulation of brain regions sensitive to food stimuli, indicating that sleep loss may lead to obesity through the selection of high-calorie food. There is also evidence that sleep restriction could provide a permissive environment for the activation of genes that promote obesity. Indeed, the heritability of body mass index is increased in short sleepers. Thus, chronic sleep curtailment, which is on the rise in modern society, including in children, is likely to contribute to the current epidemics of type 2 diabetes and obesity. (C) 2014 S.

abstract = {The neuropeptide hypocretin is also commonly referred to as orexin, since its orexigenic action was recognized early. Orexin/hypocretin (OX) neurons project widely throughout the brain and the physiologic and behavioral functions of OX are much more complex than initially conceived based upon the stimulation of feeding. OX most notably controls functions relevant to attention, alertness, and motivation. OX also plays multiple crucial roles in the control of food intake, metabolism, and overall energy balance in mammals. OX signaling not only promotes food-seeking behavior upon short-term fasting to increase food intake and defend body weight, but, conversely, OX signaling also supports energy expenditure to protect against obesity. Furthermore, OX modulates the autonomic nervous system to control glucose metabolism, including during the response to hypoglycemia. Consistently, a variety of nutritional cues (including the hormones leptin and ghrelin) and metabolites (e.g., glucose, amino acids) control OX neurons. In this chapter, we review the control of OX neurons by nutritional/metabolic cues, along with our current understanding of the mechanisms by which OX and OX neurons contribute to the control of energy balance and metabolism.},

abstract = {The distribution of fat in the body differs between the male and female sexes and is associated with the relative secretion of the two "adiposity" hormones leptin and insulin. We now report that the brains of male and female rats are differentially sensitive to the catabolic actions of small doses of these two hormones. Leptin (1 or 3.5 microg/2 microl) or saline (2 microl) was administered into the third cerebral ventricle of age- and weight-matched male and female rats. Leptin significantly reduced food intake in female and male rats over 4 h; however, leptin reduced 24-h intake in female but not in male rats. When the same rats were administered insulin (1 or 4 mU/2 microl) or saline (2 microl), male but not female rats had a robust reduction in food intake over 24 h. Previous research demonstrates the melanocortins are a central mediator of the effects of both leptin and insulin. However, we found no sex differences in sensitivity to the melanocortin agonist MTII (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 nmol/2 microl). These results suggest that the sex differences in sensitivity to leptin and insulin at the doses that we injected occur upstream of the melanocortin receptors. Because insulin and leptin reflect different fat beds and are differentially distributed in the male and female sexes, the implication is that the male and female sexes regulate adiposity-relevant parameters differently.},

abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a method extensively used in studies assessing body composition, especially in view of the high speed of information processing, as a noninvasive method for generating information through portable, easy to use and relatively inexpensive equipment that estimates the distribution of body fluids in the intra- and intercellular spaces in addition to the body components. This technique consists of the passage of a painless low amplitude electrical current applied through cables connected to electrodes or to conducting surfaces placed in contact with the skin, permitting the measurement of resistance (R) and reactance (Xc). These R and Xc values applied to mathematical equations permit the estimate of the following body compartments: fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW). In this respect, the objective of the present report is to review the main concepts involved in the BIA technique, to describe the types of BIA available, their limitations and applications to clinical practice, especially the monitoring of chronic diseases. After this review, we conclude that BIA is an important instrument for health professionals and that its use can provide safe data about body composition, in addition to complementary data about the clinical course of patients followed up on a medium- and long-term basis.},

abstract = {Aging affects energy homeostasis and fuel metabolism in a form of either an increased body mass and glucose intolerance that may lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes or loss of appetite that also may seriously compromise health status. The data, obtained mainly in rat, suggest that aging suppresses the expression and action of potent orexigenic peptides such as predominantly neuropeptides NPY and orexins as peripheral hormone, ghrelin. Senescent animals show over-responsiveness to $\alpha$MSH, the major anorexigenic neuropeptide. However, central anorexigenic action of leptin is clearly diminished in aging, most likely due to the impaired leptin signal transduction. The age-related central resistance to leptin and insulin does not reduce their inhibitory effects on the activity of NPY and AgRP neurons. Thus, in rodents aging is associated with the altered expression and activity of both orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides. If similar changes in the central regulation of food intake occur during human aging, they may partially explain 'anorexia of aging' and loss of body weight observed at the end-of-life period. Additionally, increased plasma cholecystokinin concentrations in healthy old subjects may also contribute to the loss of appetite characteristic for the elderly. Further studies of the central and peripheral mechanisms that control food intake during aging may provide novel therapeutic strategies to improve the nutritional status of the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies link short sleep duration to obesity and weight gain. Insufficient sleep appears to alter circulating levels of the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which may promote appetite, although the effects of sleep restriction on caloric intake and energy expenditure are unclear. We sought to determine the effect of 8 days/8 nights of sleep restriction on caloric intake, activity energy expenditure, and circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin. METHODS We conducted a randomized study of usual sleep vs a sleep restriction of two-thirds of normal sleep time for 8 days/8 nights in a hospital-based clinical research unit. The main outcomes were caloric intake, activity energy expenditure, and circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin. RESULTS Caloric intake in the sleep-restricted group increased by +559 kcal/d (SD, 706 kcal/d, P=.006) and decreased in the control group by -118 kcal/d (SD, 386 kcal/d, P=.51) for a net change of +677 kcal/d (95{\%} CI, 148-1,206 kcal/d; P=.014). Sleep restriction was not associated with changes in activity energy expenditure (P=.62). No change was seen in levels of leptin (P=.27) or ghrelin (P=.21). CONCLUSIONS Sleep restriction was associated with an increase in caloric consumption with no change in activity energy expenditure or leptin and ghrelin concentrations. Increased caloric intake without any accompanying increase in energy expenditure may contribute to obesity in people who are exposed to long-term sleep restriction.

abstract = {Oxytocin, a hypothalamic hormone that is secreted directly into the brain and enters the peripheral circulation through the posterior pituitary gland, regulates a range of physiologic processes, including eating behaviour and metabolism. In rodents and nonhuman primates, chronic oxytocin administration leads to sustained weight reduction by reducing food intake, increasing energy expenditure and inducing lipolysis. Oxytocin might improve glucose homeostasis, independently of its effects on weight. Clinical studies are beginning to translate these important preclinical findings to humans. This Review describes key data linking oxytocin to eating behaviour and metabolism in humans. For example, a single intranasal dose of oxytocin can reduce caloric intake, increase fat oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity in men. Furthermore, a pilot study of 8 weeks of oxytocin treatment in adults with obesity or overweight led to substantial weight loss. Together, these data support further investigation of interventions that target pathways involving oxytocin as potential therapeutics in metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic considerations and areas for further research are also discussed.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes and is a hallmark of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and many cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, quantifying insulin sensitivity/resistance in humans and animal models is of great importance for epidemiological studies, clinical and basic science investigations, and eventual use in clinical practice. Direct and indirect methods of varying complexity are currently employed for these purposes. Some methods rely on steady-state analysis of glucose and insulin, whereas others rely on dynamic testing. Each of these methods has distinct advantages and limitations. Thus, optimal choice and employment of a specific method depends on the nature of the studies being performed. Established direct methods for measuring insulin sensitivity in vivo are relatively complex. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and the insulin suppression test directly assess insulin-mediated glucose utilization under steady-state conditions that are both labor and time intensive. A slightly less complex indirect method relies on minimal model analysis of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Finally, simple surrogate indexes for insulin sensitivity/resistance are available (e.g., QUICKI, HOMA, 1/insulin, Matusda index) that are derived from blood insulin and glucose concentrations under fasting conditions (steady state) or after an oral glucose load (dynamic). In particular, the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) has been validated extensively against the reference standard glucose clamp method. QUICKI is a simple, robust, accurate, reproducible method that appropriately predicts changes in insulin sensitivity after therapeutic interventions as well as the onset of diabetes. In this Frontiers article, we highlight merits, limitations, and appropriate use of current in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity/resistance.},

abstract = {The hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding, thermogenesis, and sleeping. Orexins (also known as hypocretins) were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area. They were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior, but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Orexins activate orexin neurons, monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/brainstem regions, to maintain a long, consolidated awake period. Anatomical studies of neural projections from/to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion, energy homeostasis, reward system, and arousal. For example, orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues, including ghrelin, leptin, and glucose concentration. This suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states. A link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli. Orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction. These findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival. This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis.},

abstract = {Insufficient sleep is associated with obesity, yet little is known about how repeated nights of insufficient sleep influence energy expenditure and balance. We studied 16 adults in a 14- to 15-d-long inpatient study and quantified effects of 5 d of insufficient sleep, equivalent to a work week, on energy expenditure and energy intake compared with adequate sleep. We found that insufficient sleep increased total daily energy expenditure by ∼5{\%}; however, energy intake--especially at night after dinner--was in excess of energy needed to maintain energy balance. Insufficient sleep led to 0.82 ± 0.47 kg (±SD) weight gain despite changes in hunger and satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin, and peptide YY, which signaled excess energy stores. Insufficient sleep delayed circadian melatonin phase and also led to an earlier circadian phase of wake time. Sex differences showed women, not men, maintained weight during adequate sleep, whereas insufficient sleep reduced dietary restraint and led to weight gain in women. Our findings suggest that increased food intake during insufficient sleep is a physiological adaptation to provide energy needed to sustain additional wakefulness; yet when food is easily accessible, intake surpasses that needed. We also found that transitioning from an insufficient to adequate/recovery sleep schedule decreased energy intake, especially of fats and carbohydrates, and led to -0.03 ± 0.50 kg weight loss. These findings provide evidence that sleep plays a key role in energy metabolism. Importantly, they demonstrate physiological and behavioral mechanisms by which insufficient sleep may contribute to overweight and obesity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that diabetes is independently associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and in particular that diabetes is associated with sleep abnormalities of a central, rather than obstructive, nature. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using baseline data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), we related diabetes to 1). the respiratory disturbance index (RDI; number of apneas plus hypopneas per h of sleep); 2). obstructive apnea index (OAI; {\textgreater}or=3 apneas/h of sleep associated with obstruction of the upper airway); 3). percent of sleep time {\textless} 90{\%} O(2) saturation; 4). central apnea index (CAI; {\textgreater}or=3 apneas [without respiratory effort]/h sleep); 5). occurrence of a periodic breathing (Cheyne Stokes) pattern; and 6) sleep stages. Initial analyses excluding persons with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) were repeated including these participants. RESULTS: Of the 5874 participants included in this report, 692 (11.8{\%}) reported diabetes or were taking oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin and 1002 had prevalent CVD. Among the 4872 persons without CVD, 470 (9.6{\%}) had diabetes. Diabetic participants had worse CVD risk factor profiles than their nondiabetic counterparts, including higher BMI, waist and neck circumferences, triglycerides, higher prevalence of hypertension, and lower HDL cholesterol (P {\textless} 0.001, all). Descriptive analyses indicated differences between diabetic and nondiabetic participants in RDI, sleep stages, sleep time {\textless}90{\%} O(2) saturation, CAI, and periodic breathing (P {\textless} 0.05, all). However, multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for age, sex, BMI, race, and neck circumference eliminated these differences for all sleep measures except percent time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (19.0{\%} among diabetic vs. 20.1{\%} among nondiabetic subjects, P {\textless} 0.001) and prevalence of periodic breathing (odds ratio [OR] for diabetic subjects versus nondiabetic subjects 1.80, 95{\%} CI 1.02-3.15). Additionally, adjusted analyses showed diabetes was associated with nonstatistically significant elevations in the odds of an increased central breathing index (OR 1.42, 95{\%} CI 0.80-2.55). Addition to the analysis of the 1002 persons with prevalent CVD (including 222 people with diabetes) did not materially change these results. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that diabetes is associated with periodic breathing, a respiratory abnormality associated with abnormalities in the central control of ventilation. Some sleep disturbances may result from diabetes through the deleterious effects of diabetes on central control of respiration. The high prevalence of SDB in diabetes, although largely explained by obesity and other confounders, suggests the presence of a potentially treatable risk factor for CVD in the diabetic population.},

abstract = {AIM: There is accumulating evidence that food consumption is controlled by a wide range of brain circuits outside of the homeostatic system. Activation in these brain circuits may override the homeostatic system and also contribute to the enormous increase of obesity. However, little is known about the influence of hormonal signals on the brain's non-homeostatic system. Thus, selective insulin action in the brain was investigated by using intranasal application. METHODS: We performed 'resting-state' functional magnetic resonance imaging in 17 healthy lean female subjects to assess intrinsic brain activity by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) before, 30 and 90 min after application of intranasal insulin. RESULTS: Here, we showed that insulin modulates intrinsic brain activity in the hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore, we could show that the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex response to insulin is associated with body mass index. CONCLUSION: This demonstrates that hormonal signals as insulin may reduce food intake by modifying the reward and prefrontal circuitry of the human brain, thereby potentially decreasing the rewarding properties of food. Due to the alarming increase in obesity worldwide, it is of great importance to identify neural mechanisms of interaction between the homeostatic and non-homeostatic system to generate new targets for obesity therapy.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythm is crucial for preventing hepatic insulin resistance, although the mechanism remains uncovered. Here we report that the wake-active hypothalamic orexin system plays a key role in this regulation. Wild-type mice showed that a daily rhythm in blood glucose levels peaked at the awake period; however, the glucose rhythm disappeared in orexin knockout mice despite normal feeding rhythm. Central administration of orexin A during nighttime awake period acutely elevated blood glucose levels but subsequently lowered daytime glucose levels in normal and diabetic db/db mice. The glucose-elevating and -lowering effects of orexin A were suppressed by adrenergic antagonists and hepatic parasympathectomy, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, including Pepck, were increased and decreased by orexin A at nanomolar and femtomolar doses, respectively. These results indicate that orexin can bidirectionally regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis via control of autonomic balance, leading to generation of the daily blood glucose oscillation. Furthermore, during aging, orexin deficiency enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver and caused impairment of hepatic insulin signaling and abnormal gluconeogenic activity in pyruvate tolerance test. Collectively, the daily glucose rhythm under control of orexin appears to be important for maintaining ER homeostasis, thereby preventing insulin resistance in the liver.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rise of the gut microbiota as a major topic of research interest in biology. Studies are revealing how variations and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota influence normal physiology and contribute to diseases ranging from inflammation to obesity. Accumulating data now indicate that the gut microbiota also communicates with the CNS--possibly through neural, endocrine and immune pathways--and thereby influences brain function and behaviour. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections, probiotic bacteria or antibiotic drugs suggest a role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of anxiety, mood, cognition and pain. Thus, the emerging concept of a microbiota-gut-brain axis suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota may be a tractable strategy for developing novel therapeutics for complex CNS disorders.},

abstract = {Context In young adults, sleep affects the regulation of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. The relationship between decreased sleep quality in older adults and age- related changes in the regulation of GH and cortisol is unknown. Objective To determine the chronology of age-related changes in sleep duration and quality (sleep stages) in healthy men and whether concomitant alterations occur in GH and cortisol levels. Design and Setting Data combined from a series of studies conducted between 1985 and 1999 at 4 laboratories. Subjects A total of 149 healthy men, aged 16 to 83 years, with a mean (SD) body mass index of 24.1 (2.3) kg/m2 , without sleep complaints or histories of endocrine, psychiatric, or sleep disorders. Main Outcome Measures Twenty-four–hour profiles of plasma GH and cortisol levels and polygraphic sleep recordings. Results The mean (SEM) percentage of deep slow wave sleep decreased from 18.9{\%} (1.3{\%}) during early adulthood (age 16-25 years) to 3.4{\%} (1.0{\%}) during midlife (age 36-50 years) and was replaced by lighter sleep (stages 1 and 2) with- out significant increases in sleep fragmentation or decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The transition from midlife to late life (age 71-83 years) involved no further significant decrease in slow wave sleep but an increase in time awake of 28 minutes per decade at the expense of decreases in both light non-REM sleep (−24 minutes per decade; P?.001) and REM sleep (−10 minutes per decade; P?.001). The decline in slow wave sleep from early adulthood to midlife was paralleled by a major decline in GH secretion (−372 µg per decade; P?.001). From midlife to late life, GH secretion further declined at a slower rate (−43 µg per decade; P?.02). Independently of age, the amount of GH secretion was significantly associated with slow wave sleep (P?.001). Increasing age was associated with an elevation of evening cortisol levels (+19.3 nmol/L per decade; P?.001) that became significant only after age 50 years, when sleep became more fragmented and REM sleep declined. A trend for an association between lower amounts of REM sleep and higher evening cortisol concentrations independent of age was detected (P?.10). Conclusions In men, age-related changes in slow wave sleep and REM sleep occur with markedly different chronologies and are each associated with specific hormonal alterations. Future studies should evaluate whether strategies to enhance sleep qual- ity may have beneficial hormonal effects},

abstract = {We studied the interaction between glucocorticoid (GC) level and sleep/wake state during memory consolidation. Recent research has accumulated evidence that sleep supports memory consolidation in a unique physiological process, qualitatively distinct from consolidation occurring during wakefulness. This appears particularly true for memories that rely on the hippocampus, a region with abundant expression of GC receptors. Against this backdrop we hypothesized that GC effects on consolidation depend on the brain state, i.e., sleep and wakefulness. Following exploration of two objects in an open field, during 80 min retention periods rats received an intrahippocampal infusion of corticosterone (10 ng) or vehicle while asleep or awake. Then the memory was tested in the hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition paradigm. GCs impaired memory consolidation when administered during sleep but improved consolidation during the wake retention interval. Intrahippocampal infusion of GC or sleep/wake manipulations did not alter novel-object recognition performance that does not require the hippocampus. This work corroborates the notion of distinct consolidation processes occurring in sleep and wakefulnesss, and identifies GCs as a key player controlling distinct hippocampal memory consolidation processes in sleep and wake conditions.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of orexin A or orexin B administration on food intake in adult, male rhesus monkeys. Food intake was measured at 2 and 8 h after the morning feeding following central injections of vehicle, orexin A (10, or 20 $\mu$g) or orexin B (10, 30, or 100 $\mu$g). When compared to vehicle injections, the 10 and 20 $\mu$g doses of orexin A decreased food intake at 2 h post-dose by 45{\%} and 64{\%}, respectively. Eight-hour food intake was decreased at only the 20 $\mu$g orexin A dose. Orexin B at all doses and time points did not alter food intake when compared to vehicle.

abstract = {Recent observations have implicated hypocretin deficiency in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. Hypocretin neurotransmission also affects energy balance, and narcoleptic patients tend to become obese. Because hypocretins appear to have important neuroendocrine effects, we hypothesized that the neuroendocrine systems that regulate energy balance might be distinctly set in narcolepsy. As leptin is a pivotal part of these systems, we explored the 24-h plasma leptin (20-min sampling interval) concentration profile in six narcoleptic males and six normal controls, matched for age, sex, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, and fat mass. We thus demonstrated a reduction of the mean 24-h leptin concentration in narcoleptics to 52{\%} of that in controls (5.9 $\mu$g/liter in narcolepsy vs. 11.4 $\mu$g/liter in controls; P {\textless} 0.05). Further, a nocturnal acrophase (clock time of the highest concentration), which is typical of normal leptin secretion, was observed in controls (mean, 2335 h; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2105–0205 h), but not in narcoleptic patients. The mechanisms that potentially disturb the circadian rhythm of leptin levels in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans include anomalies of the sleep-wake cycle and/or disruption of the circadian distribution of autonomic activity. As leptin deficiency clearly leads to morbid obesity in experimental animals and humans, we infer that the observed reduction of plasma leptin levels may predispose narcoleptic humans to weight gain.},

This paper concentrates on the structural identifiability analysis of certain well-established mathematical models that have been developed to characterise glucose-insulin kinetics under different experimental scenarios. Such analysis is a pre-requisite to experiment design and parameter estimation and is applied for the first time to these models with the specific structures considered. The analysis is applied to a basic (original) form of the Minimal Model (MM) using the Taylor Series approach and a now well-accepted extended form of the MM by application of the Taylor Series approach and a form of the Similarity Transformation approach. Due to the established inappropriate nature of the MM with regard to glucose clamping experiments an alternative model describing the glucose-insulin dynamics during a Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EIC) experiment was considered. Structural identifiability analysis of the EIC model is also performed using the Taylor Series approach and shows that, with glucose infusion as input alone, the model is structurally globally identifiable. Additional analysis demonstrates that the two different model forms are structurally distinguishable for observation of both glucose and insulin.},

abstract = {I. Origin of the Insulin Sensitivity Concept HISTORICALLY, the study of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus was in the traditional pattern of endocrinology: removal of the pancreas led to experimental diabetes, and administration of insulin, a pancreatic isolate, ameliorated the diabetic symptoms (1, 2). These observations led to the widely held belief that human diabetes was primarily a disease of the pancreas, characterized by the inability of the B cell to secrete sufficient insulin to control glycemia. After insulin became available, evidence emerged suggesting that human diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial etiology. Early investigators identified an unexpected variability among diabetics in the ability of injected insulin to ameliorate hyperglycemia (3–5). Larger doses of insulin were required to normalize the blood sugar in patients with the milder nonketotic form of the disease common in the older population, whereas smaller doses were adequate for younger, ketosis-prone diabetics.},

abstract = {This study aimed at testing whether 12 rather than 26 plasma glucose and insulin determinations can be used to calculate the indices of insulin sensitivity and of glucose effectiveness using Bergman's minimal model during a simple intravenous glucose tolerance test performed without tolbutamide injection. Two intravenous glucose tolerance tests (separated by 1 week) were performed in 7 lean normal subjects and a single test was performed in 9 severely obese nondiabetic subjects. Intra-subject reproducibility of insulin sensitivity was not significantly different when 26 or 12 time-points were analyzed (CV = 16.8 +/- 3.4 versus 18.9 +/- 3.8 {\%} respectively). Compared with the insulin sensitivity of the lean subjects, that of obese subjects was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) and similarly reduced when using 12 (2.14 +/- 0.34 versus 7.97 +/- 1.29 10(-4) min(-1)/mU.1(-)1) rather than 26 determinations (2.13 +/- 0.42 versus 6.95 +/- 1.12 10(4) min(-1)/mU.1(-1)) respectively. Glucose effectiveness was less reproducible than insulin sensitivity and was slightly diminished by the reduction of blood samples (relative error : -9.7 +/- 4.4 {\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). Finally, glucose effectiveness tended to be slightly lower in the morbidly obese subjects than in the lean controls with both modes of calculation. In conclusion, in non-diabetic subjects, the insulin sensitivity index can be accurately measured during a simple intravenous glucose tolerance test, without tolbutamide injection and with only 12 blood samples. The possibility of performing a simplified test should contribute to increase the use of the minimal model method for estimating insulin sensitivity in clinical practice.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities reflects the interaction of genes that favor the storage of excess energy as fat with an environment that provides ad libitum availability of energy-dense foods and encourages an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Although weight reduction is difficult in and of itself, anyone who has ever lost weight will confirm that it is much harder to keep the weight off once it has been lost. The over 80{\%} recidivism rate to preweight loss levels of body fatness after otherwise successful weight loss is due to the coordinate actions of metabolic, behavioral, neuroendocrine and autonomic responses designed to maintain body energy stores (fat) at a central nervous system-defined 'ideal'. This 'adaptive thermogenesis' creates the ideal situation for weight regain and is operant in both lean and obese individuals attempting to sustain reduced body weights. Much of this opposition to sustained weight loss is mediated by the adipocyte-derived hormone 'leptin'. The multiple systems regulating energy stores and opposing the maintenance of a reduced body weight illustrate that body energy stores in general and obesity in particular are actively 'defended' by interlocking bioenergetic and neurobiological physiologies. Important inferences can be drawn for therapeutic strategies by recognizing obesity as a disease in which the human body actively opposes the 'cure' over long periods of time beyond the initial resolution of symptomatology.},

abstract = {Sleep is essential for health. Slow wave sleep (SWS), the deepest sleep stage hallmarked by electroencephalographic slow oscillations (SOs), appears of particular relevance here. SWS is associated with a unique endocrine milieu comprising minimum cortisol and high aldosterone, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin levels, thereby presumably fostering efficient adaptive immune responses. Yet, whether SWS causes these changes is unclear. Here we enhance SOs in men by auditory closed-loop stimulation, i.e., by delivering tones in synchrony with endogenous SOs. Stimulation intensifies the hormonal milieu characterizing SWS (mainly by further reducing cortisol and increasing aldosterone levels) and reduces T and B cell counts, likely reflecting a redistribution of these cells to lymphoid tissues. GH remains unchanged. In conclusion, closed-loop stimulation of SOs is an easy-to-use tool for probing SWS functions, and might also bear the potential to ameliorate conditions like depression and aging, where disturbed sleep coalesces with specific hormonal and immunological dysregulations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation is associated with increased risk of adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is uncertain whether sleep deprivation and/or altered sleep architecture affects glycemic regulation or insulin sensitivity or secretion. We hypothesized that in obese adolescents, sleep disturbances would associate with altered glucose and insulin homeostasis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study of 62 obese adolescents took place at the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Sleep Laboratory in a tertiary care children's hospital. Subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometric measurements, overnight polysomnography, and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and serial insulin and glucose levels were obtained, indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated, and sleep architecture was assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the association of total sleep and sleep stages with measures of insulin and glucose homeostasis, adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: We found significant U-shaped (quadratic) associations between sleep duration and both HbA(1c) and serial glucose levels on OGTT and positive associations between slow-wave sleep (N3) duration and insulin secretory measures, independent of degree of obesity, pubertal stage, sex, and obstructive sleep apnea measures. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient and excessive sleep was associated with short-term and long-term hyperglycemia in our obese adolescents. Decreased N3 was associated with decreased insulin secretion. These effects may be related, with reduced insulin secretory capacity leading to hyperglycemia. We speculate that optimizing sleep may stave off the development of T2DM in obese adolescents.},

abstract = {We attempted to improve the precision of the estimation of insulin sensitivity (S1) from the minimal model technique by modifying insulin dynamics during a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Tolbutamide and somatostatin (SRIF) were used to change the insulin dynamics without directly affecting insulin sensitivity. Injection of tolbutamide (100 mg) at t = 20 min provoked an immediate secondary peak in insulin response, resulting in a greater integrated incremental insulin than the standard FSIGT. SRIF, injected at t = -1 min, delayed insulin secretion in proportion to the dose without any change in magnitude. Computer simulation was used to assess the precision of S1 estimation. Insulin dynamics from both standard and modified protocols were adjusted in magnitude, with the shape unchanged and analyzed to determine the effect of the magnitude of insulin response. Fractional standard deviation was reduced from 73{\%} with the standard insulin profile to 23{\%} with tolbutamide and 18{\%} with the highest dose of SRIF. In addition, the fractional standard deviation of S1 estimates decreased exponentially with increasing magnitude of insulin response. Modified FSIGTs require a smaller insulin response than the standard protocol to achieve the same precision.},

Eight subjects participated in 18 4h sleep episodes to provide 4. 8 and 12 h of prior time awake before bedtimes at six different times of day in a sleep laboratory insluated from environmental disturbances. The results were analysed by ANOVAs and multiple regression techniques. Subjective sleep quality, calmness of sleep, ease of falling asleep, ability to 'sleep through', number of awakenings, and sleep latency showed a significant pattern of 'better sleep' with increasing prior time awake and with closeness to the circadiam minimum (nadir) of rectal temperature (morning hours). 'Ease of awakening' in contrast, 'decreased' with increasing time awake and with closeness to the nadir/morning hours. Multiple regression analysis showed that subjective sleep quality was predicted by subjective calmness of sleep and ease of falling asleep, among the subjective measures, and by total sleep time (TST) and slow-wave sleep (SWS - stages 3+4) among the physiological sleep measures. The subjective ease of awakening was predicted by slow-wave sleep (negatively) and the circadian maximum of rectal temperature. The results indicate that the duration of wakefulness prior to sleep and the timing of sleep determine its physiological expression, which in turn determines its subjective impression.},

Altered expression or signaling dysregulation of orexins and their receptors have been associated with a wide range of human diseases including narcolepsy, obesity, drug addiction, and cancer. Although orexin-A, its precursor molecule prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor have been detected in the human normal and hyperplastic prostate tissues, their expression and function in the prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be addressed. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the immunohistochemical localization of orexin-A in human PCa specimens, and the expression of prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor at both protein and mRNA levels in these tissues. Orexin-A administration to the human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP up-regulates OX1 receptor expression resulting in a decrease of cell survival. Noteworthy, nanomolar concentrations of the peptide counteract the testosterone-induced nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor in the cells: the orexin-A action is prevented by the addition of the OX1 receptor antagonist SB-408124 to the test system. These findings indicate that orexin-A/OX1 receptor interaction interferes with the activity of the androgen receptor which regulates PCa onset and progression, thus suggesting that orexin-A and its receptor might represent novel therapeutic targets to challenge this aggressive cancer.},

Abnormalities in insulin clearance and degradation are present in various pathological conditions including type 2 diabetes and obesity and may be important in producing clinical problems. The uptake, processing, and degradation of insulin by cells is a complex process with multiple intracellular pathways. Most evidence supports IDE as the primary degradative mechanism, but other systems (PDI, lysosomes, and other enzymes) undoubtedly contribute to insulin metabolism. Recent studies support a multifunctional role for IDE, as an intracellular binding, regulatory, and degradative protein. IDE increases proteasome and steroid hormone receptor activity, and this activation is reversed by insulin. This raises the possibility of a direct intracellular interaction of insulin with IDE that could modulate protein and fat metabolism. The recent findings would place intracellular insulin-IDE interaction into the insulin signal transduction pathway for mediating the intermediate effects of insulin on fat and protein turnover.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of obesity has lead to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in the general population. The disproportionate structural characteristics of the pharyngeal airway and the diminished neural regulation of the pharyngeal dilating muscles during sleep predispose the obese patients to pharyngeal airway collapsibility. A subgroup of obese apneic patients is unable to compensate for the added load of obesity on the respiratory system, with resultant daytime hypercapnia. Weight loss using dietary modification and life style changes is the safest approach to reducing the severity of sleep apnea, but its efficacy is limited on the long run. Although it has inherent risks, bariatric surgery provides the most immediate result in alleviating sleep apnea. Obesity has been linked also to narcolepsy. The loss of neuropeptides co-localized in hypocretin neurons is suggested as the potential mechanism. Poor sleep quality, which leads to overall sleep loss and excessive daytime sleepiness has also become a frequent complaint in this population. Identifying abnormal nocturnal eating is critically important for patient care. Both sleep related eating disorder and night eating syndrome are treatable and represent potentially reversible forms of obesity.},

abstract = {Intestinal dysbiosis and circadian rhythm disruption are associated with similar diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the overlap, the potential relationship between circadian disorganization and dysbiosis is unknown; thus, in the present study, a model of chronic circadian disruption was used to determine the impact on the intestinal microbiome. Male C57BL/6J mice underwent once weekly phase reversals of the light:dark cycle (i.e., circadian rhythm disrupted mice) to determine the impact of circadian rhythm disruption on the intestinal microbiome and were fed either standard chow or a high-fat, high-sugar diet to determine how diet influences circadian disruption-induced effects on the microbiome. Weekly phase reversals of the light:dark (LD) cycle did not alter the microbiome in mice fed standard chow; however, mice fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet in conjunction with phase shifts in the light:dark cycle had significantly altered microbiota. While it is yet to be established if some of the adverse effects associated with circadian disorganization in humans (e.g., shift workers, travelers moving across time zones, and in individuals with social jet lag) are mediated by dysbiosis, the current study demonstrates that circadian disorganization can impact the intestinal microbiota which may have implications for inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy--a loss of muscle tone generally triggered by certain strong emotions with sudden onset. The underlying cause of most cases of human narcolepsy is a loss of neurons that produce hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin). These cells normally serve to drive and synchronize the activity of monoaminergic and cholinergic cells. Sleepiness results from the reduced activity of monoaminergic, cholinergic and other cells that are normally activated by Hcrt neurons, as well as from the loss of Hcrt itself. Cataplexy is caused by an episodic loss of activity in noradrenergic cells that support muscle tone, and a linked activation of a medial medullary cell population that suppresses muscle tone. Current treatments for narcolepsy include stimulants to combat sleepiness and antidepressants to reduce cataplexy. Sodium oxybate produces both reductions in cataplexy and improved waking alertness. Future treatments are likely to include Hcrt or Hcrt agonists to reverse the underlying neurochemical deficit.},

Higher signaling of the orexin peptides at the orexin receptors (OXR) protects against obesity, but it is less clear how their activation in different brain regions contributes to this behavioral output. This review summarizes the evidence available for a role of central OXR in energy homeostasis and their contribution to obesity. A detailed analysis of anatomical, cellular and behavioral evidence shows that modulation of energy homeostasis by the OXR is largely dependent upon anatomical and cellular context. It also shows that obesity resistance provided by activation of the OXR is distributed across multiple brain sites with site-specific actions. We suggest that understanding the role of the OXR in the development of obesity requires considering both specific mechanisms within brain regions and interactions of orexinergic input between multiple sites.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin influences (feeding) behavior as well as energy metabolism. Administration of exogenous orexin-A into the brain has been shown to increase both food intake and blood glucose levels. In the present study, we investigated the role of endogenous hypothalamic orexin release in glucose homeostasis in rats. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated the effects of the hypothalamic orexin system on basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) as well as on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity by changing orexinergic activity in the hypothalamus combined with hepatic sympathetic or parasympathetic denervation, two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR studies. RESULTS Hypothalamic disinhibition of neuronal activity by the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC) increased basal EGP, especially when BIC was administered in the perifornical area where orexin-containing neurons but not melanocortin-concentrating hormone–containing neurons were activated. The increased BIC-induced EGP was largely prevented by intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the orexin-1 receptor antagonist. Intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A itself caused an increase in plasma glucose and prevented the daytime decrease of EGP. The stimulatory effect of intracerebroventricular orexin-A on EGP was prevented by hepatic sympathetic denervation. Plasma insulin clamped at two or six times the basal levels did not counteract the stimulatory effect of perifornical BIC on EGP, indicating hepatic insulin resistance. RT-PCR showed that stimulation of orexin neurons increased the expression of hepatic glucoregulatory enzymes. CONCLUSIONS Hypothalamic orexin plays an important role in EGP, most likely by changing the hypothalamic output to the autonomic nervous system. Disturbance of this pathway may result in unbalanced glucose homeostasis.},

This concept is substantiated by recent studies that map anatomical pathways, or which demonstrate that hormones and neurotransmitters associated with energy homeostasis regulation can directly modulate reward and motivation behaviors. Studies from our laboratory have focused specifically on the candidate adiposity hormones, insulin and leptin, and show that these hormones can decrease performance in behavioral paradigms that assess the rewarding or motivating properties of food. Additionally we and others have provided evidence that the ventral tegmental area may be one direct target for these effects, and we are currently exploring other potential anatomical targets. Finally, we are beginning to explore the interaction between adiposity signals, chronic maintenance diet of rats, and different types of food rewards to more closely simulate the current food environments of Westernized societies including the U.S. We propose that future studies of food reward should include a more complex environment in the experimental design that takes into account abundance and variety of rewarding foods, psychological stressors, and choices of reward modalities. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Ever since the brain was identified as an insulin-sensitive organ, evidence has rapidly accumulated that insulin action in the brain produces multiple behavioral and metabolic effects, influencing eating behavior, peripheral metabolism, and cognition. Disturbances in brain insulin action can be observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as in aging and dementia. Decreases in insulin sensitivity of central nervous pathways, i.e., brain insulin resistance, may therefore constitute a joint pathological feature of metabolic and cognitive dysfunctions. Modern neuroimaging methods have provided new means of probing brain insulin action, revealing the influence of insulin on both global and regional brain function. In this review, we highlight recent findings on brain insulin action in humans and its impact on metabolism and cognition. Furthermore, we elaborate on the most prominent factors associated with brain insulin resistance, i.e., obesity, T2D, genes, maternal metabolism, normal aging, inflammation, and dementia, and on their roles regarding causes and consequences of brain insulin resistance. We also describe the beneficial effects of enhanced brain insulin signaling on human eating behavior and cognition and discuss potential applications in the treatment of metabolic and cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute partial sleep deprivation increases plasma concentrations of ghrelin and decreases those of leptin. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to observe modifications in energy intake and physical activity after acute partial sleep deprivation in healthy men. DESIGN: Twelve men [age: 22 +/- 3 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.30 +/- 1.83] completed a randomized 2-condition crossover study. During the first night of each 48-h session, subjects had either approximately 8 h (from midnight to 0800) or approximately 4 h (from 0200 to 0600) of sleep. All foods consumed subsequently (jam on buttered toast for breakfast, buffet for lunch, and a free menu for dinner) were eaten ad libitum. Physical activity was recorded by an actimeter. Feelings of hunger, perceived pleasantness of the foods, desire to eat some foods, and sensation of sleepiness were also evaluated. RESULTS: In comparison with the 8-h sleep session, subjects consumed 559 +/- 617 kcal (ie, 22{\%}) more energy on the day after sleep restriction (P {\textless} 0.01), and preprandial hunger was higher before breakfast (P {\textless} 0.001) and dinner (P {\textless} 0.05). No change in the perceived pleasantness of the foods or in the desire to eat the foods was observed. Physical activity from 1215 to 2015 was higher after sleep restriction than after 8 h of sleep (P {\textless} 0.01), even though the sensation of sleepiness was more marked (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: One night of reduced sleep subsequently increased food intake and, to a lesser extent, estimated physical activity-related energy expenditure in healthy men. These experimental results, if confirmed by long-term energy balance measurements, suggest that sleep restriction could be a factor that promotes obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00986492.},

Despite the frequent use of a complex, poly-drug pharmacotherapy, treatment for fibromyalgia is of limited efficacy. Oxytocin has been reported to reduce the severity of pain, anxiety, and depression, and improve the quality of sleep, suggesting that it may be useful to treat fibromyalgia. To evaluate this hypothesis, 14 women affected by fibromyalgia and comorbid disorders, assuming a complex pharmacotherapy, were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover, randomized trial to receive oxytocin and placebo nasal spray daily for 3 weeks for each treatment. Order of treatment (placebo-oxytocin or oxytocin-placebo) was randomly assigned. Patients were visited once a week. At each visit, the following instruments were administered: an adverse drug reaction record card, Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, and SF-12. Women self-registered painkiller assumption, pain severity, and quality of sleep in a diary. Unlikely, oxytocin nasal spray (80 IU a day) did not induce positive therapeutic effects but resulted to be safe, devoid of toxicity, and easy to handle.  2014 Springer-Verlag.$\backslash$n},

We measured orexin A fasting plasma levels by the RIA method in 58 obese children--33 girls and 25 boys; mean age 13.1+/-0.38 years (range 7-18.5) before and after 5 weeks of weight-reduction therapy. Leptin, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels were measured in all the subjects and were compared to orexin A levels and anthropometrical data. Average weight in subjects before weight-reduction was 74.2+/-2.79 kg and after weight-loss 67.4+/-2.60 kg (p{\textless}0.0001). Orexin A levels before the therapy were 33.3+/-1.97 pg/ml and after the therapy 51.7+/-3.07 pg/ml (p{\textless}0.0001). Levels of orexin A were not significantly different between girls and boys (p=0.7842). We found negative correlation between orexin A and age (r = -0.5395; p{\textless}0.0001), body height (r = -0.4751; p=0.0002), body weight (r = -0.4030; p=0.0017) and BMI (r = -0.2607; p=0.0481). No correlation was found between orexin A and IGF-1, IGFBP-3 or leptin. Orexin A plasma levels increased during body weight loss, whereas the reverse was true for leptin levels. These findings support the hypothesis that orexin A may be involved in regulation of nutritional status in children.},

Being overweight and obese is associated with numerous comorbidities and is a risk factor for several of the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and many types of cancer. The foundation of treatment has been diet and exercise. There are {\textgreater}1,000 published weight loss diets, with more appearing in the lay literature and the media on a regular basis. The sheer number of existing diet regimens would suggest that no one diet has been universally successful at inducing and maintaining weight loss. Many of these dietary programs are based on sound scientific evidence and follow contemporary principles of weight loss. Others simply eliminate 1 or more of the essential food groups or recommend consumption of 1 type of food at the expense of other foods with little to no supporting evidence. The focus of this review is on weight loss diets, specifically those with the most supporting scientific evidence and those that are most likely to succeed in achievement and maintenance of desirable body weight. The effects of weight loss diets on energy expenditure, body weight, body composition, and metabolic parameters will be evaluated. Ultimately, the best diet is the one the patient will follow and incorporate into his or her daily life for lifelong maintenance of a healthy body weight.},

In this Review, we describe how unbiased, high-throughput screens in model organisms are uncovering sleep regulatory mechanisms and how pathways, such as the circadian clock network and specific neurotransmitter signals, have conserved effects on sleep from Drosophila to humans. At the same time, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered ???14 loci increasing susceptibility to sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy and restless leg syndrome.

abstract = {Compared to a few decades ago, adults, as well as children, sleep less. Sleeping as little as possible is often seen as an admirable behavior in contemporary society. However, sleep plays a major role in neuroendocrine function and glucose metabolism. Evidence that the curtailment of sleep duration may have adverse health effects has emerged in the past 10 years. Accumulating evidence from both epidemiologic studies and well-controlled laboratory studies indicates that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and weight gain. The present chapter reviews epidemiologic studies in adults and children and laboratory studies in young adults indicating that sleep restriction results in metabolic and endocrine alterations, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, increased evening concentrations of cortisol, increased levels of ghrelin, decreased levels of leptin and increased hunger and appetite. Altogether, the evidence points to a possible role of decreased sleep duration in the current epidemic of obesity. Bedtime extension in short sleepers should be explored as a novel behavioral intervention that may prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss. Avoiding sleep deprivation may help to prevent the development of obesity, particularly in children.},

abstract = {The orexin-A/hypocretin-1 and orexin-B/hypocretin-2 are neuropeptides synthesized by a cluster of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area. Orexin neurons receive a variety of signals related to environmental, physiological and emotional stimuli, and project broadly to the entire CNS. Orexin neurons are "multi-tasking" neurons regulating a set of vital body functions, including sleep/wake states, feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, reward systems, cognition and mood. Furthermore, a dysfunction of orexinergic system may underlie different pathological conditions. A selective loss orexin neurons was found in narcolepsia, supporting the crucial role of orexins in maintaining wakefulness. In animal models, orexin deficiency lead to obesity even if the consume of calories is lower than wildtype counterpart. Reduced physical activity appears the main cause of weight gain in these models resulting in energy imbalance. Orexin signaling promotes obesity resistance via enhanced spontaneous physical activity and energy expenditure regulation and the deficiency/dysfunction in orexins system lead to obesity in animal models despite of lower calories intake than wildtype associated with reduced physical activity. Interestingly, orexinergic neurons show connections to regions involved in cognition and mood regulation, including hippocampus. Orexins enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and improve spatial learning and memory abilities, and mood. Conversely, orexin deficiency results in learning and memory deficits, and depression},

In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep dysregulation disorder with alterations of REM sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods and REM sleep instability. Deficient orexin-A (hypocretin-1) signaling is assumed to be a major cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy. In this study we investigated fourteen subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy in a within-subject, random-order crossover, placebo-controlled design. Patients received double-blinded intranasal orexin-A (435. nmol) or sterile water (placebo) in the morning. Administration was preceded by an adaptation night and followed by a modified maintenance of wakefulness test, attention testing and a second full night of polysomnographic recording. We found comparable sleep behavior during the adaptation nights between both conditions. After orexin-A administration patients had less wake-REM sleep transitions and a decreased REM sleep duration. In the subsequent night, patients showed an increased N2 duration. In the test of divided attention, patients had fewer false reactions after orexin-A administration. Our results support orexin-A to be a REM sleep stabilizing factor and provide functional signs for effects of orexin-A on sleep alterations and attention in narcolepsy with cataplexy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mixed-effects models are being used ever more frequently in the analysis of experimental data. However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subsequent nights with partial sleep restriction result in impaired glucose tolerance, but the effects on insulin sensitivity have not been characterized.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single night of partial sleep restriction on parameters of insulin sensitivity.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine healthy subjects (five men, four women) were studied once after a night of normal sleep duration (sleep allowed from 2300 to 0730 h), and once after a night of 4 h of sleep (sleep allowed from 0100 to 0500 h). Sleep characteristics were assessed by polysomnography. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies (from 1130 to 1430 h) with infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose.

RESULTS: Sleep duration was shorter in the night with sleep restriction than in the unrestricted night (226 +/- 11 vs. 454 +/- 9 min; P{\textless} 0.0001). Sleep restriction did not affect basal levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, or endogenous glucose production. Sleep restriction resulted in increased endogenous glucose production during the hyperinsulinemic clamp study compared to the unrestricted night (4.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.2 micromol x kg lean body mass(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.017), indicating hepatic insulin resistance. In addition, sleep restriction decreased the glucose disposal rate during the clamp (32.5 +/- 3.6 vs. 40.7 +/- 5.1 micromol x kg lean body mass(-1) x min(-1); P = 0009), reflecting decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Accordingly, sleep restriction decreased the rate of glucose infusion by approximately 25{\%} (P = 0.001). Sleep restriction increased plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels during the clamp study (68 +/- 5 vs. 57 +/- 4 micromol/liter; P = 0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: Partial sleep deprivation during only a single night induces insulin resistance in multiple metabolic pathways in healthy subjects. This physiological observation may be of relevance for variations in glucoregulation in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {The concurrent background level of metabolic activity may control state of vigilance, promoting wakefulness (and hunger) when it is low, or sleep (and satiety) when it is high. In a series of experiments, we have shown that sleep is dependent on feeding, but only because of the metabolic consequences of food ingestion. These consequences are sensed by glioneuronal populations (at least in the rostromedial hypothalamus), which probably respond to channel-bound adenosine triphosphate/diphosphate turnover (ischymetric monitoring) rather than to the binding of such downstream molecules as adenosine and cytochrome c oxidase. This basic signal is communicated to the vigilance-controlling centers by a cascade of peptidic and nonpeptidic messengers-messengers that promote wakefulness and hunger, possibly via a hypometabolic action (as in the case of neuropeptide Y or hypocretins), or somnolence and satiety, possibly via a hypermetabolic action (as in the case of leptin or certain serotonergic agents). ?? 2006.},

abstract = {The neuropeptides orexin-A and orexin-B are produced in neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area and have been implicated to be involved in the regulation of food/water intake and sleep-wake control. The orexins act at two different G-protein-coupled orexin receptors (OX-R1 and OX-R2) that are derived from separate genes and expressed differentially throughout the central nervous system. In the present study, we have used a polyclonal antipeptide antiserum to analyse in detail the distribution of OX-R1-immunoreactive neurons in the rat hypothalamus. In order to identify the chemical mediators of orexin action in the hypothalamus, the OX-R1-containing neurons were characterized with regard to the content of peptides shown previously to affect ingestive and drinking behaviour. Neurons containing OX-R1 immunoreactivity were widely distributed in the hypothalamus with cell bodies located in the suprachiasmatic, periventricular, paraventricular (both magno- and parvocellular division), supraoptic, arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial and tuberomammillary nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area. In magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, OX-R1 immunoreactivity was seen in both vasopressin- and oxytocin-containing neurons. OX-R1 immunoreactivity was demonstrated in vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in somatostatin neurons of the periventricular nucleus and in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons of the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus. In the arcuate nucleus, OX-R1 immunoreactivity was present in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons of the ventromedial part as well as in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) neurons of the ventrolateral division. In the lateral hypothalamic area, OX-R1 immunoreactivity was demonstrated in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)- and orexin-containing neurons. In the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus, OX-R1-immunoreactivity was shown in many histamine-containing neurons. The results support the idea that orexins have important actions on hypothalamic neurons that control food intake and fluid balance, but also that orexins may regulate other neuroendocrine systems.},

One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a time-varying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model.

abstract = {Orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play key roles in the regulation of wakefulness, feeding, reward, autonomic functions and energy homeostasis. To control these functions indispensable for survival, orexin-expressing neurones integrate peripheral metabolic signals, interact with many types of neurones in the brain and modulate their activities via the activation of orexin-1 receptor or orexin-2 receptor. In addition, a new functional role of orexin is emerging in the regulation of insulin and leptin sensitivities responsible for whole-body glucose metabolism. Recent evidence indicates that orexin efficiently protects against the development of peripheral insulin resistance induced by ageing or high-fat feeding in mice. In particular, the orexin receptor-2 signalling appears to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity and insulin insensitivity by improving leptin sensitivity. In fact, the expression of orexin gene is known to be down-regulated by hyperglycaemia in the rodent model of diabetes, such as ob/ob and db/db mice. Moreover, the levels of orexin receptor-2 mRNA have been shown to decline in the brain of mice along with ageing. These suggest that hyperglycaemia due to insulin insensitivity during ageing or by habitual consumption of a high-fat diet leads to the reduction in orexin expression in the hypothalamus, thereby further exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance. Therefore, orexin receptor controlling hypothalamic insulin/leptin actions may be a new target for possible future treatment of hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {By acting in the central nervous system, circulating insulin may regulate food intake and body weight. We have previously shown that the kinetics of insulin uptake from plasma into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can best be explained by passage through an intermediate compartment. To determine if transport kinetics into this compartment were consistent with an insulin receptor-mediated transport process, we subjected overnight fasted, anesthetized dogs to euglycemic intravenous insulin infusions for 90 min over a wide range of plasma insulin levels (69-5,064 microU/ml) (n = 10). Plasma and CSF samples were collected over 8 h for determination of immunoreactive insulin levels, and the kinetics of insulin uptake from plasma into CSF were analyzed using a compartmental model with three components (plasma--{\textgreater}intermediate compartment--{\textgreater}CSF). By sampling frequently during rapid changes of plasma and CSF insulin levels, we were able to precisely estimate three parameters (average standard deviation 14{\%}) characterizing the uptake of insulin from plasma, through the intermediate compartment and into CSF (k1k2); insulin entry into CSF and insulin clearance from the intermediate compartment (k2 + k3); and insulin clearance from CSF (k4). At physiologic plasma insulin levels (80 +/- 7.4 microU/ml), k1k2 was determined to be 10.7 x 10(-6) +/- 1.3 x 10(-6) min-2. With increasing plasma levels, however, k1k2 decreased progressively, being reduced sevenfold at supraphysiologic levels (5,064 microU/ml). The apparent KM of this saturation curve was 742 microU/ml (approximately 5 nM). In contrast, the rate constants for insulin removal from the intermediate compartment and from CSF did not vary with plasma insulin (k2 + k3 = 0.011 +/- 0.0019 min-1 and k4 = 0.046 +/- 0.021 min-1). We conclude that delivery of plasma insulin into the central nervous system is saturable, and is likely facilitated by an insulin-receptor mediated transport process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preclinical studies indicate that oxytocin is anorexigenic and has beneficial metabolic effects. Oxytocin effects on nutrition and metabolism in humans are not well defined. It was hypothesized that oxytocin would reduce caloric intake and appetite and alter levels of appetite-regulating hormones. Metabolic effects of oxytocin were also explored. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of single-dose intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) in 25 fasting healthy men was performed. After oxytocin/placebo, subjects selected breakfast from a menu and were given double portions. Caloric content of food consumed was measured. Visual analog scales were used to assess appetite, and blood was drawn for appetite-regulating hormones, insulin, and glucose before and after oxytocin/placebo. Indirect calorimetry assessed resting energy expenditure (REE) and substrate utilization. RESULTS: Oxytocin reduced caloric intake with a preferential effect on fat intake and increased levels of the anorexigenic hormone cholecystokinin without affecting appetite or other appetite-regulating hormones. There was no effect of oxytocin on REE. Oxytocin resulted in a shift from carbohydrate to fat utilization and improved insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal oxytocin reduces caloric intake and has beneficial metabolic effects in men without concerning side effects. The efficacy and safety of sustained oxytocin administration in the treatment of obesity warrants investigation.},

abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems.},

These cells normally serve to drive and synchronize the activity of monoaminergic and cholinergic cells. Sleepiness results from the reduced activity of monoaminergic, cholinergic and other cells that are normally activated by Hcrt neurons, as well as from the loss of Hcrt itself. Cataplexy is caused by an episodic loss of activity in noradrenergic cells that support muscle tone, and a linked activation of a medial medullary cell population that suppresses muscle tone. Current treatments for narcolepsy include stimulants to combat sleepiness and antidepressants to reduce cataplexy. Sodium oxybate produces both reductions in cataplexy and improved waking alertness. Future treatments are likely to include Hcrt or Hcrt agonists to reverse the underlying neurochemical deficit.},

abstract = {Insufficient sleep is associated with obesity, yet little is known about how repeated nights of insufficient sleep influence energy expenditure and balance. We studied 16 adults in a 14- to 15-d-long inpatient study and quantified effects of 5 d of insufficient sleep, equivalent to a work week, on energy expenditure and energy intake compared with adequate sleep. We found that insufficient sleep increased total daily energy expenditure by ∼5{\%}; however, energy intake--especially at night after dinner--was in excess of energy needed to maintain energy balance. Insufficient sleep led to 0.82 ± 0.47 kg (±SD) weight gain despite changes in hunger and satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin, and peptide YY, which signaled excess energy stores. Insufficient sleep delayed circadian melatonin phase and also led to an earlier circadian phase of wake time. Sex differences showed women, not men, maintained weight during adequate sleep, whereas insufficient sleep reduced dietary restraint and led to weight gain in women. Our findings suggest that increased food intake during insufficient sleep is a physiological adaptation to provide energy needed to sustain additional wakefulness; yet when food is easily accessible, intake surpasses that needed. We also found that transitioning from an insufficient to adequate/recovery sleep schedule decreased energy intake, especially of fats and carbohydrates, and led to -0.03 ± 0.50 kg weight loss. These findings provide evidence that sleep plays a key role in energy metabolism. Importantly, they demonstrate physiological and behavioral mechanisms by which insufficient sleep may contribute to overweight and obesity.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

abstract = {The simultaneous assessment of insulin action, secretion, and hepatic extraction is key to understanding postprandial glucose metabolism in nondiabetic and diabetic humans. We review the oral minimal method (i.e., models that allow the estimation of insulin sensitivity, $\beta$-cell responsivity, and hepatic insulin extraction from a mixed-meal or an oral glucose tolerance test). Both of these oral tests are more physiologic and simpler to administer than those based on an intravenous test (e.g., a glucose clamp or an intravenous glucose tolerance test). The focus of this review is on indices provided by physiological-based models and their validation against the glucose clamp technique. We discuss first the oral minimal model method rationale, data, and protocols. Then we present the three minimal models and the indices they provide. The disposition index paradigm, a widely used $\beta$-cell function metric, is revisited in the context of individual versus population modeling. Adding a glucose tracer to the oral dose significantly enhances the assessment of insulin action by segregating insulin sensitivity into its glucose disposal and hepatic components. The oral minimal model method, by quantitatively portraying the complex relationships between the major players of glucose metabolism, is able to provide novel insights regarding the regulation of postprandial metabolism.},

Therefore, circuits controlling both sleep and metabolism are likely to play a role in these physiopathological conditions. The hypocretin (Hcrt) system is a strong candidate for mediating both sleep and metabolic imbalances because Hcrt neurons are sensitive to metabolic hormones, including leptin and ghrelin, and modulate arousal and goal-orientated behaviours. This review discusses the role of Hcrt neurons as a sensors of energy balance and arousal and proposes new ways of probing local hypothalamic circuits regulating sleep and metabolism with unprecedented cellular specificity and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. Here we review evidence for an active system consolidation occurring during sleep. At the beginning of this process is sleep's ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in hippocampal networks. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of specific memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in extrahippocampal regions. We propose that reactivations during sleep are a general mechanism underlying the abstraction of temporally stable invariants from a flow of input that is solely structured in time, thus representing a basic mechanism of memory formation.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES The ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) and the orexin/hypocretin neuronal system are key regulators of sleep onset, transitions between vigilance states, and energy homeostasis. Reciprocal projections exist between the VLPO and orexin/hypocretin neurons. Although the importance of the VLPO to sleep regulation is clear, it is unknown whether VLPO neurons are involved in energy balance. The purpose of these studies was to determine if the VLPO is a site of action for orexin-A, and which orexin receptor subtype(s) would mediate these effects of orexin-A. We hypothesized that orexin-A in the VLPO modulates behaviors (sleep and wakefulness, feeding, spontaneous physical activity [SPA]) to increase energy expenditure. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS Sleep, wakefulness, SPA, feeding, and energy expenditure were determined after orexin-A microinjection in the VLPO of male Sprague-Dawley rats with unilateral cannulae targeting the VLPO. We also tested whether pretreatment with a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA, TCS-1102) or an OX2R antagonist (JNJ-10397049) blocked the effects of orexin-A on the sleep/wake cycle or SPA, respectively. RESULTS Orexin-A injected into the VLPO significantly increased wakefulness, SPA, and energy expenditure (SPA-induced and total) and reduced NREM sleep and REM sleep with no effect on food intake. Pretreatment with DORA blocked the increase in wakefulness and the reduction in NREM sleep elicited by orexin-A, and the OX2R antagonist reduced SPA stimulated by orexin-A. CONCLUSIONS These data show the ventrolateral preoptic area is a site of action for orexin-A, which may promote negative energy balance by modulating sleep/wakefulness and stimulating spontaneous physical activity and energy expenditure.},

abstract = {The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin regulates reproductive behavior and mother-infant interaction, and conclusive studies in humans indicate that oxytocin is also a potent modulator of psychosocial function. Pilot experiments have yielded first evidence that this neuropeptide moreover influences eating behavior. Brain administration of oxytocin in animals with normal weight, but also with diet-induced or genetically induced obesity, attenuates food intake and reduces body weight. In normal-weight and obese individuals, acute intranasal oxytocin delivery curbs calorie intake from main dishes and snacks. Such effects might converge with the poignant social and cognitive impact of oxytocin to also improve dysfunctional eating behavior in the therapeutic context. This assumption has received support in first studies showing that oxytocin might play a role in the disease process of anorexia nervosa. In contrast, respective experiments in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are still scarce. We briefly summarize currently available studies on the involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of eating disorders, as well as on the effects of oxytocin administration in patients with these disorders. We propose a framework of oxytocin's role and its therapeutic potential in eating disorders that aims at integrating social and metabolic aspects of its pharmacological profile, and ponder perspectives and limitations of oxytocin use in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {Sleep reduction is associated with increased energy intake and weight gain, though few studies have explored the relationship between sleep architecture and energy balance measures in the context of experimental sleep restriction. Fourteen males and 13 females (body mass index: 22-26 kg/m(2)) participated in a crossover sleep curtailment study. Participants were studied under two sleep conditions: short (4 h/night; 0100-0500 h) and habitual (9 h/night; 2200-0700 h), for 5 nights each. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded nightly. Outcome measures included resting metabolic rate (RMR), feelings of appetite-satiety, and ad libitum food intake. Short sleep resulted in reductions in stage 2 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration (P {\textless} 0.001), as well as decreased percentage of stage 2 sleep and REM sleep and increased slow wave sleep (SWS) percentage (P {\textless} 0.05). Linear mixed model analysis demonstrated a positive association between stage 2 sleep duration and RMR (P = 0.051). Inverse associations were observed between REM sleep duration and hunger (P = 0.031) and between stage 2 sleep duration and appetite for sweet (P = 0.015) and salty (P = 0.046) foods. Stage 2 sleep percentage was inversely related to energy consumed (P = 0.024). Stage 2 sleep (P = 0.005), SWS (P = 0.008), and REM sleep (P = 0.048) percentages were inversely related to fat intake, and SWS (P = 0.040) and REM sleep (P = 0.050) were inversely related to carbohydrate intake. This study demonstrates that changes in sleep architecture are associated with markers of positive energy balance and indicate a means by which exposure to short sleep duration and/or an altered sleep architecture profile may lead to excess weight gain over time.},

Previous work has shown that clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have low firing rates during the LSP, but it is not known how this reduced activity enhances vasopressin release. We found that synaptic excitation of rat supraoptic nucleus neurons by osmosensory afferents is facilitated during the LSP. Stimulation of the SCN at this time inhibited excitatory synaptic currents induced in supraoptic neurons by activation of osmosensory afferents. This effect was associated with an increased rate of synaptic failures and occurred without changes in frequency facilitation, quantal size or in the ratio of postsynaptic responses mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors. We conclude that clock neurons mediate an activity-dependent presynaptic silencing of osmosensory afferent synapses onto vasopressin neurons and that osmoregulatory gain is enhanced by removal of this effect during late sleep.},

abstract = {Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase Cbeta triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.},

An immediate increase in face washing activity was observed after injection of orexin A or orexin B, but not NPY. Orexin A had a more potent effect on face washing behavior than orexin B. Grooming and burrowing activities also increased significantly after injection of orexin A, whereas, orexin B significantly increased burrowing and searching behavior. Feeding behavior and food consumption increased dramatically within 10 min of injection of NPY. Although the significant increase in feeding behavior was also observed after injection of orexin A, total food intake did not change significantly.

abstract = {Findings from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the hormone insulin has chronic effects within the CNS to regulate energy homeostasis and to decrease brain reward function. In this study, we compared the acute action of insulin to decrease intake of a palatable food in two different behavioral tasks-progressive ratios sucrose self-administration and micro opioid-stimulated sucrose feeding-when administered into several insulin-receptive sites of the CNS. We tested insulin efficacy within the medial hypothalamic arcuate (ARC) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei, the nucleus accumbens, and the ventral tegmental area. Administration of insulin at a dose that has no chronic effect on body weight (5 mU) into the ARC significantly suppressed sucrose self-administration (75+/-5{\%} of paired control). However, although the mu opioid DAMGO, [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin acetate salt, stimulated sucrose intake at all four CNS sites, the ventral tegmental area was the only sensitive site for a direct effect of insulin to antagonize acute (60 min) micro opioid-stimulated sucrose feeding: sucrose intake was 53+/-8{\%} of DAMGO-induced feeding, when insulin was coadministered with DAMGO. These findings demonstrate that free feeding of sucrose, and motivated work for sucrose, can be modulated within unique sites of the CNS reward circuitry. Further, they support the interpretation that adiposity signals, such as insulin, can decrease different aspects of ingestion of a palatable food, such as sucrose, in an anatomically specific manner.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that diabetes is independently associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and in particular that diabetes is associated with sleep abnormalities of a central, rather than obstructive, nature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using baseline data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), we related diabetes to 1). the respiratory disturbance index (RDI; number of apneas plus hypopneas per h of sleep); 2). obstructive apnea index (OAI; {\textgreater}or=3 apneas/h of sleep associated with obstruction of the upper airway); 3). percent of sleep time {\textless} 90{\%} O(2) saturation; 4). central apnea index (CAI; {\textgreater}or=3 apneas [without respiratory effort]/h sleep); 5). occurrence of a periodic breathing (Cheyne Stokes) pattern; and 6) sleep stages. Initial analyses excluding persons with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) were repeated including these participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 5874 participants included in this report, 692 (11.8{\%}) reported diabetes or were taking oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin and 1002 had prevalent CVD. Among the 4872 persons without CVD, 470 (9.6{\%}) had diabetes. Diabetic participants had worse CVD risk factor profiles than their nondiabetic counterparts, including higher BMI, waist and neck circumferences, triglycerides, higher prevalence of hypertension, and lower HDL cholesterol (P {\textless} 0.001, all). Descriptive analyses indicated differences between diabetic and nondiabetic participants in RDI, sleep stages, sleep time {\textless}90{\%} O(2) saturation, CAI, and periodic breathing (P {\textless} 0.05, all). However, multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for age, sex, BMI, race, and neck circumference eliminated these differences for all sleep measures except percent time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (19.0{\%} among diabetic vs. 20.1{\%} among nondiabetic subjects, P {\textless} 0.001) and prevalence of periodic breathing (odds ratio [OR] for diabetic subjects versus nondiabetic subjects 1.80, 95{\%} CI 1.02-3.15). Additionally, adjusted analyses showed diabetes was associated with nonstatistically significant elevations in the odds of an increased central breathing index (OR 1.42, 95{\%} CI 0.80-2.55). Addition to the analysis of the 1002 persons with prevalent CVD (including 222 people with diabetes) did not materially change these results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that diabetes is associated with periodic breathing, a respiratory abnormality associated with abnormalities in the central control of ventilation. Some sleep disturbances may result from diabetes through the deleterious effects of diabetes on central control of respiration. The high prevalence of SDB in diabetes, although largely explained by obesity and other confounders, suggests the presence of a potentially treatable risk factor for CVD in the diabetic population.},

This concept primarily derives from experiments in animals where substances can be directly applied to the brain. A feasible approach to study the impact of peptidergic messengers on brain function in humans is the intranasal (IN) route of administration, which bypasses the blood–brain barrier and delivers neuropeptides to the brain compartment, but induces considerably less, if any, peripheral uptake than other administration modes. Experimental IN insulin administration has been extensively used to delineate the role of brain insulin signaling in the control of energy homeostasis, but also cognitive function in healthy humans.

abstract = {The hypothalamic melanocortin system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Orexins (hypocretins) are also involved in a diverse range of physiological processes, including food intake. Previous evidence has suggested that hypothalamic orexin expression may be influenced by the central melanocortin system. Here, we studied orexin mRNA levels in pro-opiomelanocortin-deficient (Pomc-/-) mice, a mouse model lacking all endogenously produced melanocortin peptides. Orexin expression in the lateral hypothalamus was significantly increased in corticosterone deficient Pomc-/- mice. Furthermore, when circulating glucocorticoids were restored to levels within the physiological range, orexin expression remained elevated. However, i.c.v. administration of the melanocortin $\alpha$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) to Pomc-/- mice reduced orexin expression back down to wild-type levels. This was independent of the effects of $\alpha$-MSH on food intake because elevated orexin expression persisted in Pomc-/- mice pairfed to $\alpha$-MSH-treated animals. These data indicate that $\alpha$-MSH may play a role in the regulation of orexin expression in Pomc-/-, with an elevation in orexin levels contributing to the hyperphagia seen in these animals. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

The Type II analysis (Yates's method of fitting constants) is usually not preferred because of the underlying assumption of no interactions.

We sought to investigate the existence of FGF21 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if present, the relationship between CSF FGF21 with body adiposity and metabolic parameters. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CSF and corresponding plasma FGF21 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18 men and 20 women, aged 19-80 years, and BMI 16.2-38.1 kg/m(2)) and correlated to body adiposity and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: CSF and plasma FGF21 increased in particular with rising BMI and fat mass. In CSF, FGF21 was detectable at concentrations {\~{}}40{\%} that of plasma levels. CSF and plasma FGF21 levels were significantly positively correlated with BMI and fat mass, body weight, plasma insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Plasma FGF21 levels were significantly negatively correlated with plasma adiponectin. When subjected to multiple regression analysis, only fat mass was predictive of plasma FGF21 (beta = 0.758; P = 0.004) and CSF FGF21 (beta = 0.767; P = 0.007). The CSF-to-plasma FGF21 ratio was significantly negatively correlated with BMI, fat mass, and plasma FGF21. Subjects in the highest plasma FGF21 quintile had a lower CSF-to-plasma FGF21 ratio (12.7{\%} [9.7-14.9{\%}]) compared with those in the lowest plasma FGF21 quintile (94.7{\%} [37.3-99.8{\%}]) (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations have important implications with respect to the potential central actions of FGF21. Future research should seek to clarify whether FGF21 would be beneficial in the management of obesity and its metabolic complications},

This review summarizes the role of orexins in the regulation of feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis in relation to other systems that involve orexinergic neurotransmission.},

Furthermore, recent findings have suggested a more general role for the central nervous system in metabolic control, and have revealed the importance of a number of cues and hypothalamic circuits. The brain's contributions to metabolic control are more readily revealed and play a crucial part in catabolic states or in hormone deficiencies that mimic starvation.},

abstract = {Individuals undergoing treatment for a symptom like pain expect that the treatment will reduce the pain. Many studies show that healthy volunteers or patients in pain report less pain after inactive treatment, if they believe that active medication has been administrated. The reduction of pain can be partly blocked by systemic administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist. There is reduced central nervous system activation to painful stimuli in individuals who have been given a placebo and told it is a painkiller. These findings suggest that the expectation of pain relief generates central nervous system opioid activity that inhibits pain transmission to the cerebral cortex. Expectations may thus lead to changes in central nervous system activity that reduces pain. It is proposed that expectations activate a homeostatic system that corrects perturbations to the system via negative feedback. The nocebo effect is the opposite of the placebo effect, and is due to induction of negative emotions. Part of the treatment of many symptoms and diseases is due to autonomic adjustments controlled by the central nervous system. The involvement of emotional processes in placebo effects could have important consequences for interpretation of data from randomized controlled trials.},

However, no mechanisms are known to cross-regulate prokaryotic and eukaryotic circadian rhythms in multikingdom ecosystems. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota, in both mice and humans, exhibits diurnal oscillations that are influenced by feeding rhythms, leading to time-specific compositional and functional profiles over the course of a day. Ablation of host molecular clock components or induction of jet lag leads to aberrant microbiota diurnal fluctuations and dysbiosis, driven by impaired feeding rhythmicity. Consequently, jet-lag-induced dysbiosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation. Together, these findings provide evidence of coordinated metaorganism diurnal rhythmicity and offer a microbiome-dependent mechanism for common metabolic disturbances in humans with aberrant circadian rhythms, such as those documented in shift workers and frequent flyers.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous data suggest a key role of central nervous insulin action in regulating energy homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: We therefore investigated whether insulin modulates brain responses to food and nonfood pictures in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Nine healthy, normal-weight subjects underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements to compare the effects of insulin and placebo administration during a visual recognition task with food and nonfood pictures. Insulin was administered intranasally to raise insulin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid without altering systemic effects in the periphery. Metabolic parameters were continuously determined during the experiments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We measured the changes in brain activity after intranasal insulin administration. RESULTS: Food pictures were detected faster when compared to nonfood pictures in all conditions without any effect of placebo or insulin. After insulin application, functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements showed a significantly reduced activity in the presence of food pictures compared to placebo in the right and left fusiform gyrus, the right hippocampus, the right temporal superior cortex, and the right frontal middle cortex. The brain activation induced by nonfood pictures remained unaffected by insulin. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that intranasal insulin led to a reduction of activity in brain areas related to object processing and memory and may have an effect on brain activation with regard to the processing of food pictures. This effect might be part of a mechanism that terminates food intake in the postprandial state.},

abstract = {The lateral hypothalamic hypocretin (also called orexin) neurons have emerged as instrumental in triggering arousal and regulating energy metabolism. The lack of hypocretin signaling is the cause of narcolepsy while elevated hypocretin levels induce arousal, elevated food intake, and adiposity. Here, we report an unorthodox synaptic organization on the hypocretin neurons in which excitatory synaptic currents and asymmetric synapses exert control on the cell bodies of these long-projective neurons with minimal inhibitory input. Overnight food deprivation promotes the formation of more excitatory synapses and synaptic currents onto hypocretin cells; this is reversed by re-feeding and blocked by leptin administration. This unique wiring and acute stress-induced plasticity of the hypocretin neurons correlates well with their being involved in the control of arousal and alertness that are so vital to survival, but this circuitry may also be an underlying cause of insomnia and associated metabolic disturbances, including obesity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Sleep disturbances [short ({\textless}6 h) and long ({\textgreater}8 h) sleeping time, insomnia (initiating or maintaining sleep), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and abnormal sleep timing] have been associated with increased diabetes risk but the effect size relative to that of traditional risk factors is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk associated with sleep disturbances to traditional risk factors. Studies were identified from Medline and Scopus. Cohort studies measuring the association between sleep disturbances and incident diabetes were eligible. For traditional risk factors (i.e., overweight, family history, and physical inactivity), systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis were included. Thirty-six studies (1,061,555 participants) were included. Pooled relative risks (RRs) of sleep variables were estimated using a random-effect model. Pooled RRs of sleeping ≤5 h, 6 h, and ≥9 h/d were respectively 1.48 (95{\%}CI:1.25,1.76), 1.18 (1.10,1.26) and 1.36 (1.12,1.65). Poor sleep quality, OSA and shift work were associated with diabetes with a pooled RR of 1.40 (1.21,1.63), 2.02 (1.57, 2.61) and 1.40 (1.18,1.66), respectively. The pooled RRs of being overweight, having a family history of diabetes, and being physically inactive were 2.99 (2.42,3.72), 2.33 (1.79,2.79), and 1.20 (1.11,1.32), respectively. In conclusion, the risk of developing diabetes associated with sleep disturbances is comparable to that of traditional risk factors. Sleep disturbances should be considered in clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes screening.},

Dysregulation or loss of orexin signaling has been linked to narcolepsy, obesity, and age-related disorders. In this review, we present an overview of our current understanding of orexin function, focusing on sleep disorders, energy balance, and aging, in both rodents and humans. We first discuss animal models used in studies of obesity and sleep, including loss of function using transgenic or viral-mediated approaches, gain of function models using exogenous delivery of orexin receptor agonist, and naturally-occurring models in which orexin responsiveness varies by individual. We next explore rodent models of orexin in aging, presenting evidence that orexin loss contributes to age-related changes in sleep and energy balance. In the next section, we focus on clinical importance of orexin in human obesity, sleep, and aging. We include discussion of orexin loss in narcolepsy and potential importance of orexin in insomnia, correlations between animal and human studies of age-related decline, and evidence for orexin involvement in age-related changes in cognitive performance. Finally, we present a summary of recent studies of orexin in neurodegenerative disease. We conclude that orexin acts as an integrative homeostatic signal influencing numerous brain regions, and that this pivotal role results in potential dysregulation of multiple physiological processes when orexin signaling is disrupted or lost.},

abstract = {There is convincing evidence that, in humans, discrete sleep stages are important for daytime brain function, but whether any particular sleep stage has functional significance for the rest of the body is not known. Deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), is thought to be the most “restorative” sleep stage, but beneficial effects of SWS for physical well being have not been demonstrated. The initiation of SWS coincides with hormonal changes that affect glucose regulation, suggesting that SWS may be important for normal glucose tolerance. If this were so, selective suppression of SWS should adversely affect glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that, in young healthy adults, all-night selective suppression of SWS, without any change in total sleep time, results in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensatory increase in insulin release, leading to reduced glucose tolerance and increased diabetes risk. SWS suppression reduced delta spectral power, the dominant EEG frequency range in SWS, and left other EEG frequency bands unchanged. Importantly, the magnitude of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in SWS. These findings demonstrate a clear role for SWS in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that reduced sleep quality with low levels of SWS, as occurs in aging and in many obese individuals, may contribute to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

We show that the brain region receiving the densest innervation from orexinergic nerves is the locus coeruleus, a key modulator of attentional state, where application of orexin A increases cell firing of intrinsic noradrenergic neurones. Orexin A increases arousal and locomotor activity and modulates neuroendocrine function. The data suggest that orexin A plays an important role in orchestrating the sleep-wake cycle.},

abstract = {Objectives: Acoustic stimulation synchronized to slow waves (SWs) can enhance these sleep features and facilitate memory consolidation during nocturnal sleep. Here, we investigated whether a similar benefit could be accrued following stimulation during an afternoon nap. We also evaluated the event-related dynamics of associated EEG spectral changes and their correlation with memory performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy young adults (mean age: 22 ?? 1.4 years; nine males) were studied under two conditions: stimulation (STIM) and no stimulation (SHAM), in counter-balanced order. In the STIM condition, acoustic stimulation was delivered using blocks of five tones, each phase-locked to the SW up-state during a 90-min nap opportunity. In the SHAM condition, these time points were marked, but tones were not presented. Prior to the nap, participants learned 40 semantically related word pairs and immediate recall was tested. A delayed recall test was administered 45 min after awakening. Results: Compared to the SHAM condition, acoustic stimulation increased SW amplitude, theta, and fast spindle activity and attenuated the forgetting of word pairs (p values {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Phase-locked acoustic stimulation can promote sleep-dependent declarative memory during a daytime nap. This can be achieved by stimulation in Stage 2 and SWS without a requirement for high-amplitude slow wave detection.},

@article{Wurtman2006,
abstract = {Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic disease characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and one or more of three additional symptoms (cataplexy, or sudden loss of muscle tone; vivid hallucinations; and brief periods of total paralysis) related to the occurrence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at inappropriate times. The daytime sleepiness typically presents as a sudden overwhelming urge to sleep, followed by periods of sleep that last for seconds or minutes, or even longer. During daytime sleep episodes, patients may exhibit "automatic behavior," performing conventionalized functions (eg, taking notes), but not remembering having done so once they are awake. About 10{\%} of narcoleptics are members of familial clusters; however, genetic factors alone are apparently insufficient to cause the disease, inasmuch as the most common genetic disorder, a mutation in chromosome 6 controlling the HLA antigen immune complex, although seen in 90{\%} to 100{\%} of patients, also occurs in as many as 50{\%} of people without narcolepsy. A dog model of narcolepsy exhibits a mutation on chromosome 12 that disrupts the processing of the peptide neurotransmitter hypocretin. No such mutation characterizes human narcolepsy; however, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin levels are profoundly depressed in narcoleptic patients, and a specific reduction in hypocretin-containing neurons has been described. One hypothesis concerning the pathophysiology of narcolepsy proposes that the HLA subtype resulting from the mutation on chromosome 6 increases the susceptibility of hypocretin-containing brain neurons to immune attack. Because hypocretin may normally participate in the maintenance of wakefulness, the loss of neurons that release this peptide might allow REM sleep to occur at inappropriate times, ie, while the patient is awake, in contrast to its normal cyclic appearance after a period of slow-wave sleep. The cataplexy, hallucinations, and/or paralysis associated with REM episodes normally are unnoticed-or, at least, not remembered-when the transition to REM follows slow wave sleep, as is normally the case; however, they are remembered when, in people with narcolepsy, the REM episode starts during a period of wakefulness. The association of narcolepsy with a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter, in this case, hypocretin, is reminiscent of the associations between Parkinson disease and dopamine, or early Alzheimer disease and acetylcholine. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Consumption beyond homeostatic needs, referred to here as reward-based feeding behavior, is a central contributor to the current obesity epidemic worldwide. Importantly, reward-based feeding can be driven by palatability, the taste and texture of the food, as well as cues associated with the consumption of palatable foods. The hypothalamic orexin system regulates both diet preference and anticipation of food rewards making it a likely target to modulate reward-based feeding behavior. In the current manuscript we hypothesized that orexin signaling mediates food-motivated behaviors and reward-based feeding behavior. We further hypothesized that orexin neurons and targets of the orexin system become activated in response to cues associated with the consumption of palatable food. Data from these studies suggest that orexin signaling promotes progressive ratio responding for palatable foods while blockade of orexin signaling attenuates reward-based feeding of a high fat diet. In addition, cues linked to the consumption of chocolate, or the receipt of a daily meal, activate the orexin system and its target regions differentially. Collectively, these data suggest that orexin signaling mediates reward-based feeding behavior and, within specific target regions, may regulate cue-induced overconsumption of palatable foods. ?? 2010 IBRO.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Short sleep duration is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and an increased risk of diabetes. The effects of sleep restriction on insulin sensitivity have not been established. This study tests the hypothesis that decreasing nighttime sleep duration reduces insulin sensitivity and assesses the effects of a drug, modafinil, that increases alertness during wakefulness.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 12-day inpatient General Clinical Research Center study included 20 healthy men (age 20-35 years and BMI 20-30 kg/m(2)). Subjects spent 10 h/night in bed for {\textgreater}or=8 nights including three inpatient nights (sleep-replete condition), followed by 5 h/night in bed for 7 nights (sleep-restricted condition). Subjects received 300 mg/day modafinil or placebo during sleep restriction. Diet and activity were controlled. On the last 2 days of each condition, we assessed glucose metabolism by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Salivary cortisol, 24-h urinary catecholamines, and neurobehavioral performance were measured.

RESULTS: IVGTT-derived insulin sensitivity was reduced by (means +/- SD) 20 +/- 24{\%} after sleep restriction (P = 0.001), without significant alterations in the insulin secretory response. Similarly, insulin sensitivity assessed by clamp was reduced by 11 +/- 5.5{\%} (P {\textless} 0.04) after sleep restriction. Glucose tolerance and the disposition index were reduced by sleep restriction. These outcomes were not affected by modafinil treatment. Changes in insulin sensitivity did not correlate with changes in salivary cortisol (increase of 51 +/- 8{\%} with sleep restriction, P {\textless} 0.02), urinary catecholamines, or slow wave sleep.

CONCLUSIONS: Sleep restriction (5 h/night) for 1 week significantly reduces insulin sensitivity, raising concerns about effects of chronic insufficient sleep on disease processes associated with insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Intranasal drug delivery is a noninvasive drug delivery route that can enhance systemic delivery of therapeutics with poor oral bioavailability by exploiting the rich microvasculature within the nasal cavity. The intranasal delivery route has also been targeted as a method for improved brain uptake of neurotherapeutics, with a goal of harnessing putative, direct nose-to-brain pathways. Studies in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans have pointed to the efficacy of intranasally delivered neurotherapeutics, while radiolabeling studies have analyzed brain uptake following intranasal administration. In the present study, we employed carbon-11 radioactive methylation to assess the pharmacokinetic mechanism of intranasal delivery of Orexin A, a native neuropeptide and prospective antinarcoleptic drug that binds the orexin receptor 1. Using physicochemical and pharmacological analysis, we identified the methylation sites and confirmed the structure and function of methylated Orexin A (CH 3 -Orexin A) prior to monitoring its brain uptake following intranasal administration in rodent and nonhuman primate. Through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of [ 11 C]CH 3 -Orexin A, we determined that the brain exposure to Orexin A is poor after intranasal administration. Additional ex vivo analysis of brain uptake using [ 125 I]Orexin A indicated intranasal administration of Orexin A affords similar brain uptake when compared to intravenous administration across most brain regions, with possible increased brain uptake localized to the olfactory bulbs.},

abstract = {Temporal control of brain and behavioral states emerges as a consequence of the interaction between circadian and homeostatic neural circuits. This interaction permits the daily rhythm of sleep and wake, regulated in parallel by circadian cues originating from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and arousal-promoting signals arising from the orexin-containing neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus (TH). Intriguingly, the SCN circadian clock can be reset by arousal-promoting stimuli while activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons is believed to be under circadian control, suggesting the existence of a reciprocal relationship. Unfortunately, since orexin neurons are themselves activated by locomotor promoting cues, it is unclear how these two systems interact to regulate behavioral rhythms. Here mice were placed in conditions of constant light, which suppressed locomotor activity, but also revealed a highly pronounced circadian pattern in orexin neuronal activation. Significantly, activation of orexin neurons in the medial and lateral TH occurred prior to the onset of sustained wheel-running activity. Moreover, exposure to a 6 h dark pulse during the subjective day, a stimulus that promotes arousal and phase advances behavioral rhythms, activated neurons in the medial and lateral TH including those containing orexin. Concurrently, this stimulus suppressed SCN activity while activating cells in the median raphe. In contrast, dark pulse exposure during the subjective night did not reset SCN-controlled behavioral rhythms and caused a transient suppression of neuronal activation in the TH. Collectively these results demonstrate, for the first time, pronounced circadian control of orexin neuron activation and implicate recruitment of orexin cells in dark pulse resetting of the SCN circadian clock.},

abstract = {The hypothalamic neurohormone oxytocin decreases food intake via largely unexplored mechanisms. We investigated the central nervous mediation of oxytocin's hypophagic effect in comparison to its impact on the processing of generalized rewards. Fifteen fasted normal-weight, young men received intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo before functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity during exposure to food stimuli and a monetary incentive delay task (MID). Subsequently, ad-libitum breakfast intake was assessed. Oxytocin compared to placebo increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in response to high- vs. low-calorie food images in the fasted state, and reduced calorie intake by 12{\%}. During anticipation of monetary rewards, oxytocin compared to placebo augmented striatal, orbitofrontal and insular activity without altering MID performance. We conclude that during the anticipation of generalized rewards, oxytocin stimulates dopaminergic reward-processing circuits. In contrast, oxytocin restrains food intake by enhancing the activity of brain regions that exert cognitive control, while concomitantly increasing the activity of structures that process food reward value. This pattern points towards a specific role of oxytocin in the regulation of eating behaviour in humans that might be of relevance for potential clinical applications.},

We hypothesized that a decreased amount of SWS is a feature peculiar to subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHOD A retrospective case-control study analyzed polysomnographic recordings and covariate data of 22 type 2 diabetic and 22 nondiabetic subjects [n = 44; 8 women, 36 men, aged 57.5 +/- 5.5 years, body mass index (BMI) 33.8 +/- 5.9 kg/m(2), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 29.6 +/- 22.2 episodes/hr] matched individually for sex, race, age, BMI, and severity of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). We assessed differences in sleep architecture between the study group and the control group. Primary end points included the percentage of total sleep time spent in each sleep stage. RESULTS Despite similar age and severity of SRBD, subjects with type 2 diabetes demonstrated a significantly decreased amount of SWS (3.9 +/- 5.95{\%} vs 8.4 +/- 4.57{\%}; p = 0.012), increased percentage time in rapid eye movement sleep (24.1 +/- 12.14{\%} vs 13.8 +/- 6.96{\%}; p = 0.005), and higher arousal index (44.3 +/- 19.53/hr vs 35.7 +/- 12.67/hr; p = 0.037) compared to nondiabetic controls. After adjustment for sex, BMI, AHI, and smoking, age and presence of type 2 diabetes were independent predictors of the decreased SWS percentage (p = 0.001). Variables in this model accounted for 34{\%} of the variance in the SWS percentage in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrated distinct differences in sleep architecture in our cohort with decreased amounts of SWS in type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that polysomnographic recognition of altered sleep architecture may be partially implicated in the early detection of persons with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) stimulates feeding and activates neurons in brain sites regulating feeding and arousal. The feeding effects of orexin A have been demonstrated during the light cycle, a time when rats are normally resting, and the effect of orexin A on activity after injection into the LH has not been previously measured. Thus, it is unclear whether LH orexin A-induced feeding is secondary to enhanced arousal. To address this, LH-cannulated rats habituated to a running wheel were injected with either orexin A (1000 pmol) or vehicle during light and dark cycles. Food intake and running wheel rotations were measured for 2 h. Spontaneous physical activity (SPA) was also measured during the dark cycle. During the light cycle, orexin A in the LH stimulated feeding in the presence and absence of a running wheel and increased number of running wheel rotations in the presence and absence of food. During the dark cycle, orexin A in the LH induced SPA (±presence of food), but had no effect on feeding. These data show that LH orexin A stimulation of feeding is not always coincident with increased activity, suggesting that feeding induced by LH-injected orexin A is not consequent to enhanced arousal.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Short sleep duration is correlated with an increased risk of developing obesity and cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms behind this relation are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the hypothesis that acute sleep loss decreases physical activity while increasing food intake, thereby shifting 2 crucial behavioral components of energy homeostasis toward weight gain. DESIGN In 15 healthy, normal-weight men, spontaneous physical activity was registered by accelerometry during the entire experiment, and food intake as well as relevant hormones were assessed during a 15-h daytime period after 2 nights of regular sleep (bed time: 2245-0700) and after 2 nights of restricted sleep (bed time: 0245-0700). Experiments were performed in a crossover design. RESULTS Sleep restriction significantly decreased physical activity during the daytime spent under free-living conditions after the first night of sleep manipulation (P = 0.008). Also, intensities of physical activity were shifted toward lower levels, with less time spent with intense activities (P = 0.046). Total energy intake, feelings of hunger, and appetite as well as ghrelin and leptin concentrations during day 2 remained unaffected by acute sleep restriction. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to our expectation, short-term sleep loss neither increased food intake nor affected concentrations of the hunger-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin. However, the observed decrease in daytime physical activity may point to another potentially important behavioral mechanism for the health-impairing influence of sleep loss.},

On all nights the subjects went to bed at 2300 h and were wakened at 0700 h. On the baseline night, the lights were turned off at 2300 h, enabling the subject to fall asleep. To delay sleep onset, on the second night, the subjects were kept awake until 0200 h. On the third night, the subjects were deprived of SWS between 2300 h and 0200 h. SWS deprivation was accomplished by sounding a tone as soon as it appeared the subject was going into stage 3 sleep. The order of experimental conditions was randomized. On the baseline nights, the occurrence of SWS was closely associated with the occurrence of GH secretory bursts, and plasma cortisol concentrations were low at that time. Delaying sleep onset after 0200 h substantially delayed the GH secretory bursts, which again coincided with the initial periods of SWS. Deprivation of SWS between 2300 h and 0200 h did not significantly reduce the time spent in SWS, because it recovered after the deprivation was discontinued. On these nights, the GH secretory peaks were not significantly changed in amplitude. However, they were dissociated from SWS, because they occurred mostly subsequent to sleep onset rather than during the main epochs of SWS occurring after 0200 h. Nocturnal cortisol release was distinctly delayed with delayed sleep onset, whereas temporary SWS suppression had no significant effect. Thus, the timing of both nocturnal GH and cortisol secretion seems more dependent on sleep onset than on SWS. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Chronic sleep loss as a consequence of voluntary bedtime restriction is an endemic condition in modern society. Although sleep exerts marked modulatory effects on glucose metabolism, and molecular mechanisms for the interaction between sleeping and feeding have been documented, the potential impact of recurrent sleep curtailment on the risk for diabetes and obesity has only recently been investigated. In laboratory studies of healthy young adults submitted to recurrent partial sleep restriction, marked alterations in glucose metabolism including decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity have been demonstrated. The neuroendocrine regulation of appetite was also affected as the levels of the anorexigenic hormone leptin were decreased, whereas the levels of the orexigenic factor ghrelin were increased. Importantly, these neuroendocrine abnormalities were correlated with increased hunger and appetite, which may lead to overeating and weight gain. Consistent with these laboratory findings, a growing body of epidemiological evidence supports an association between short sleep duration and the risk for obesity and diabetes. Chronic sleep loss may also be the consequence of pathological conditions such as sleep-disordered breathing. In this increasingly prevalent syndrome, a feedforward cascade of negative events generated by sleep loss, sleep fragmentation, and hypoxia are likely to exacerbate the severity of metabolic disturbances. In conclusion, chronic sleep loss, behavioral or sleep disorder related, may represent a novel risk factor for weight gain, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Males have proportionally more visceral fat and are more likely to develop complications associated with obesity than females, and the male brain is relatively more sensitive to the catabolic action of insulin and less sensitive to that of leptin than the female brain. To understand the underlying mechanism, we manipulated estrogen through ovariectomy (OVX) and estradiol administration. Rats with relatively high systemic estrogen (intact females and OVX females and males administered estrogen subcutaneously) were significantly more sensitive to leptin's anorexic action in the brain (i3vt), as well as significantly less sensitive to insulin's i3vt action, than intact males. Administering estradiol directly into the brain of our females increased i3vt leptin sensitivity while decreasing i3vt insulin sensitivity and changed the body fat distribution of our females to resemble that of intact females. These data indicate that estrogen acts within the brain to increase leptin sensitivity, decrease insulin sensitivity, and favor subcutaneous over visceral fat.},

abstract = {An emerging body of evidence suggests that an increased prevalence of insulin abnormalities and insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to the disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms. It has long been known that insulin is essential for energy metabolism in the periphery. In the past 2 decades, convergent findings have begun to demonstrate that insulin also plays a role in energy metabolism and other aspects of CNS function. Investigators reported 20 years ago that insulin and insulin receptors were densely but selectively expressed in the brain, including the medial temporal regions that support the formation of memory. It has recently been demonstrated that insulin-sensitive glucose transporters are localised to the same regions supporting memory and that insulin plays a role in memory functions. Collectively, these findings suggest that insulin may contribute to normal cognitive functioning and that insulin abnormalities may exacerbate cognitive impairments, such as those associated with Alzheimer's disease. Insulin may also play a role in regulating the amyloid precursor protein and its derivative beta-amyloid (Abeta), which is associated with senile plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. It has been proposed that insulin can accelerate the intracellular trafficking of Abeta and interfere with its degradation. These findings are consistent with the notion that insulin abnormalities may potentially influence levels of Abeta in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The increased occurrence of insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease and the numerous mechanisms through which insulin may affect clinical and pathological aspects of the disease suggest that improving insulin effectiveness may have therapeutic benefit for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone has been shown to have a potent insulin-sensitising action that appears to be mediated through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). PPAR-gamma agonists, such as rosiglitazone, also have anti-inflammatory effects that may be of therapeutic benefit in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This review presents evidence suggesting that insulin resistance plays a role in the pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Based on this evidence, we propose that treatment of insulin resistance may reduce the risk or retard the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The finding of orexin (hypocretin) deficiency in patients with narcolepsy suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining sleep/wakefulness states and energy homeostasis. Orexin might be especially important for stabilization of behavioral states, because the major symptom in narcolepsy is instability of each behavioral state, which results in sleep/wakefulness fragmentation. The efferent and afferent systems of orexin neurons suggest interactions between these cells and arousal/sleep-wakefulness centers in the brainstem as well as important feeding centers in the hypothalamus. Electrophysiological studies have shown that orexin neurons are regulated by monoamines and acetylcholine as well as metabolic cues, including leptin, glucose, and ghrelin. Thus, orexin neurons have the requisite functional interactions with hypothalamic feeding pathways and monoaminergic/cholinergic centers, and provide a critical link between peripheral energy balance and the central mechanisms that coordinate sleep/wakefulness and motivated behavior such as food seeking. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Altered metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance are key pathological features of both diseases. For many years, it was generally considered that the brain was insensitive to insulin, but it is now accepted that this hormone has central neuromodulatory functions, including roles in learning and memory, that are impaired in AD. However, until recently, the molecular mechanisms accounting for brain insulin resistance in AD have remained elusive. Here, we review recent evidence that sheds light on how brain insulin dysfunction is initiated at a molecular level and why abnormal insulin signaling culminates in synaptic failure and memory decline. We also discuss the cellular basis underlying the beneficial effects of stimulation of brain insulin signaling on cognition. Discoveries summarized here provide pathophysiological background for identification of novel molecular targets and for development of alternative therapeutic approaches in AD. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Alzheimer's Association.

abstract = {Cerebral insulin exerts anorexic effects in humans and animals. The underlying mechanisms, however, are not clear. Because insulin physiologically facilitates glucose uptake by most tissues of the body and thereby fosters intracellular energy supply, we hypothesized that intranasal insulin reduces food consumption via enhancement of the neuroenergetic level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject comparison, 15 healthy men (BMI 22.2 +/- 0.37 kg/m(2)) aged 22-28 years were intranasally administered insulin (40 IU) or placebo after an overnight fast. Cerebral energy metabolism was assessed by (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At 100 min after spray administration, participants consumed ad libitum from a test buffet. Our data show that intranasal insulin increases brain energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels). Cerebral energy content correlates inversely with subsequent calorie intake in the control condition. Moreover, the neuroenergetic rise upon insulin administration correlates with the consecutive reduction in free-choice calorie consumption. Brain energy levels may therefore constitute a predictive value for food intake. Given that the brain synchronizes food intake behavior in dependence of its current energetic status, a future challenge in obesity treatment may be to therapeutically influence cerebral energy homeostasis. Intranasal insulin, after optimizing its application schema, seems a promising option in this regard.},

Other hypothalamic neurons stabilize the switch, and their absence results in inappropriate switching of behavioural states, such as occurs in narcolepsy.

abstract = {Sleep is an important modulator of neuroendocrine function and glucose metabolism in children as well as in adults. In recent years, sleep curtailment has become a hallmark of modern society with both children and adults having shorter bedtimes than a few decades ago. This trend for shorter sleep duration has developed over the same time period as the dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity. There is rapidly accumulating evidence from both laboratory and epidemiological studies to indicate that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and weight gain. The present article reviews laboratory evidence indicating that sleep curtailment in young adults results in a constellation of metabolic and endocrine alterations, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, elevated sympathovagal balance, increased evening concentrations of cortisol, increased levels of ghrelin, decreased levels of leptin, and increased hunger and appetite. We also review cross-sectional epidemiological studies associating short sleep with increased body mass index and prospective epidemiological studies that have shown an increased risk of weight gain and obesity in children and young adults who are short sleepers. Altogether, the evidence points to a possible role of decreased sleep duration in the current epidemic of obesity.},

abstract = {The present experiments were designed to compare the influences of delayed sleep onset and temporary slow wave sleep (SWS) deprivation on nocturnal GH and cortisol release in humans. Polysomnographic recordings and blood samples were obtained from 10 male subjects each participating on three experimental nights. On all nights the subjects went to bed at 2300 h and were wakened at 0700 h. On the baseline night, the lights were turned off at 2300 h, enabling the subject to fall asleep. To delay sleep onset, on the second night, the subjects were kept awake until 0200 h. On the third night, the subjects were deprived of SWS between 2300 h and 0200 h. SWS deprivation was accomplished by sounding a tone as soon as it appeared the subject was going into stage 3 sleep. The order of experimental conditions was randomized. On the baseline nights, the occurrence of SWS was closely associated with the occurrence of GH secretory bursts, and plasma cortisol concentrations were low at that time. Delaying sleep onset after 0200 h substantially delayed the GH secretory bursts, which again coincided with the initial periods of SWS. Deprivation of SWS between 2300 h and 0200 h did not significantly reduce the time spent in SWS, because it recovered after the deprivation was discontinued. On these nights, the GH secretory peaks were not significantly changed in amplitude. However, they were dissociated from SWS, because they occurred mostly subsequent to sleep onset rather than during the main epochs of SWS occurring after 0200 h. Nocturnal cortisol release was distinctly delayed with delayed sleep onset, whereas temporary SWS suppression had no significant effect. Thus, the timing of both nocturnal GH and cortisol secretion seems more dependent on sleep onset than on SWS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Sleep curtailment has been linked to obesity, but underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study assessed whether sleep restriction alters 24-h profiles of appetite-regulating hormones ghrelin, leptin, and pancreatic polypeptide during a standardized diet and whether these hormonal alterations predict food intake during ad libitum feeding. METHODS Nineteen healthy, lean men were studied under normal sleep and sleep restriction in a randomized crossover design. Blood samples were collected for 24 h during standardized meals. Subsequently, participants had an ad libitum feeding opportunity (buffet meals and snacks) and caloric intake was measured. RESULTS Ghrelin levels were increased after sleep restriction as compared with normal sleep (P {\textless} 0.01). Overall, sleep restriction did not alter leptin or pancreatic polypeptide profiles. Sleep restriction was associated with an increase in total calories from snacks by 328 ± 140 kcal (P = 0.03), primarily from carbohydrates (P = 0.02). The increase in evening ghrelin during sleep restriction was correlated with higher consumption of calories from sweets (r = 0.48, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Sleep restriction as compared with normal sleep significantly increases ghrelin levels. The increase in ghrelin is associated with higher consumption of calories. Elevated ghrelin may be a mechanism by which sleep loss leads to increased food intake and the development of obesity.},

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples - at minimum cholinergic activity - coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity - at high cholinergic and theta activity - might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.},

Hyperglycemic clamp technique. The plasma glucose concentration is acutely raised to 125 mg/dl above basal levels by a priming infusion of glucose. The desired hyperglycemic plateau is subsequently maintained by adjustment of a variable glucose infusion, based on the negative feedback principle. Because the plasma glucose concentration is held constant, the glucose infusion rate is an index of glucose metabolism. Under these conditions of constant hyperglycemia, the plasma insulin response is biphasic with an early burst of insulin release during the first 6 min followed by a gradually progressive increase in plasma insulin concentration. Euglycemic insulin clamp technique. The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised and maintained at approximately 100 muU/ml by a prime-continuous infusion of insulin. The plasma glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion using the negative feedback principle. Under these steady-state conditions of euglycemia, the glucose infusion rate equals glucose uptake by all the tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin.},

abstract = {Intranasal administration of insulin has been shown to influence neuroendocrine functions via an effect on central nervous mechanisms. Because insulin, in particular when infused into cerebral arteries, induces blood pressure (BP) elevation by an unknown mechanism, we investigated whether insulin exerts similar effects on BP after intranasal administration. To evaluate the immediate effects of insulin on BP, 20 IU of human insulin was intranasally administered every 10 minutes over a 2-hour period. Blood pressure, heart rate, and muscular sympathetic nervous activity (MSNA) were continuously monitored. For evaluating the effects of subchronic administration of insulin, changes during and after 8 weeks of treatment with 160 IU insulin/d on BP were monitored. Compared with placebo, the immediate nasal administration of insulin raised diastolic BP (12.21{\%} ?? 5.10{\%}; P {\textless} .05), mean arterial BP (10.81{\%} ?? 4.32{\%}; P {\textless} .04), and systolic BP (9.53{\%} ?? 4.66{\%}; P {\textless} .08), whereas MSNA and heart rate were unaffected. In contrast, prolonged intranasal insulin administration did not affect BP (P {\textgreater} .62 for all comparisons). The immediate increase in BP in the face of an unsuppressed MSNA after insulin suggests that intranasal insulin transiently changes the baroreflex set point. Thus, data suggest that intranasal insulin administration affects BP regulatory centers in the brain. However, the effect is not observed with prolonged administration of the hormone, suggesting the emergence of counterregulatory processes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In contrast to these animal models, most human narcolepsy is not familial, is discordant in identical twins, and has not been linked to mutations of the Hcrt system. Thus, the cause of human narcolepsy remains unknown. Here we show that human narcoleptics have an 85{\%}-95{\%} reduction in the number of Hcrt neurons. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, which are intermixed with Hcrt cells in the normal brain, are not reduced in number, indicating that cell loss is relatively specific for Hcrt neurons. The presence of gliosis in the hypocretin cell region is consistent with a degenerative process being the cause of the Hcrt cell loss in narcolepsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Several methods have been proposed to evaluate insulin sensitivity from the data obtained from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, the validity of these indices has not been rigorously evaluated by comparing them with the direct measurement of insulin sensitivity obtained with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In this study, we compare various insulin sensitivity indices derived from the OGTT with whole-body insulin sensitivity measured by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this study, 153 subjects (66 men and 87 women, aged 18-71 years, BMI 20-65 kg/m2) with varying degrees of glucose tolerance (62 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, 31 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and 60 subjects with type 2 diabetes) were studied. After a 10-h overnight fast, all subjects underwent, in random order, a 75-g OGTT and a euglycemic insulin clamp, which was performed with the infusion of [3-3H]glucose. The indices of insulin sensitivity derived from OGTT data and the euglycemic insulin clamp were compared by correlation analysis. RESULTS The mean plasma glucose concentration divided by the mean plasma insulin concentration during the OGTT displayed no correlation with the rate of whole-body glucose disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp (r = -0.02, NS). From the OGTT, we developed an index of whole-body insulin sensitivity (10,000/square root of [fasting glucose x fasting insulin] x [mean glucose x mean insulin during OGTT]), which is highly correlated (r = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.0001) with the rate of whole-body glucose disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp. CONCLUSIONS Previous methods used to derive an index of insulin sensitivity from the OGTT have relied on the ratio of plasma glucose to insulin concentration during the OGTT. Our results demonstrate the limitations of such an approach. We have derived a novel estimate of insulin sensitivity that is simple to calculate and provides a reasonable approximation of whole-body insulin sensitivity from the OGTT.},

In Experiment 2, intra-VMH infusion of specific insulin antibodies (1.5 $\mu$Ueq/h) increased BW and FI, while C-peptide antibodies were ineffective. In Experiment 3a, intracerebroventricular infusions of insulin failed to decrease FI and BW comparably to similar intrahypothalamic infusions. In Experiment 3b, intra-VMH insulin was infused via cannulae that bypassed the cerebral ventricles. The decrease in FI and BW was comparable to that observed when insulin was infused via cannulae that penetrated a ventricle. Histology from animals used in Experiments 1–3 indicates that optimum sites for insulin-induced changes in BW and FI in the hypothalamus lie in an area that includes portions of the paraventricular, arcuate, dorsomedial, and ventromedial nuclei.},

abstract = {Low food intake in elderly individuals increases the risk for many nutrition-related acute or chronic illnesses. It is not known whether aging is associated with changes in hunger and satiety, or whether elderly individuals can regulate energy intake in response to manipulations of the energy or nutrient content of foods. Therefore, this study investigated short-term energy regulation in healthy elderly (n = 16; aged 60-84 y) and young (n = 16; aged 18-35 y) men. Participants were given yogurt preloads that varied in energy and macronutrient content (low-fat, low energy, 962 kJ; high-fat, high-energy, 2134 kJ; high-carbohydrate, high-energy 2134 kJ), or no yogurt, followed by a self-selected lunch (presented 30 min after subjects began to consume the yogurt). Energy intake, the percentage of macronutrients consumed in the meals, and subjective sensations of hunger and satiety were analyzed. The elderly men consumed significantly less energy than the young men in the baseline (no yogurt) condition. Lower intake was concordant with subjective sensations of satiety; visual analog data indicated that the older men were less hungry and more full at the start of lunch. Compensation for energy in the preloads was less precise in the elderly than in the young men, in that elderly men consistently overate at the self-selected lunch. Young men consumed +/- 10{\%} total energy (lunch + yoghurt) in the yogurt preload conditions compared with their baseline intake; elderly men overate between 10{\%} and 30{\%} in relation to their baseline intake. The proportions of macronutrients consumed in the test meals did not differ significantly across preload conditions or between the young and elderly participants. There were also no differences between the satiating effects of fat and carbohydrate. These results indicate that energy regulation is impaired in elderly individuals. Consuming an energy-dense nutritional supplement before a meal may be an appropriate strategy to increase energy and nutrient intakes in elderly people.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, evidence has accumulated that the human brain is an insulin-sensitive organ. Insulin regulates activity in a limited number of specific brain areas that are important for memory, reward, eating behaviour and the regulation of whole-body metabolism. Accordingly, insulin in the brain modulates cognition, food intake and body weight as well as whole-body glucose, energy and lipid metabolism. However, brain imaging studies have revealed that not everybody responds equally to insulin and that a substantial number of people are brain insulin resistant. In this Review, we provide an overview of the effects of insulin in the brain in humans and the relevance of the effects for physiology. We present emerging evidence for insulin resistance of the human brain. Factors associated with brain insulin resistance such as obesity and increasing age, as well as possible pathogenic factors such as visceral fat, saturated fatty acids, alterations at the blood-brain barrier and certain genetic polymorphisms, are reviewed. In particular, the metabolic consequences of brain insulin resistance are discussed and possible future approaches to overcome brain insulin resistance and thereby prevent or treat obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are outlined.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW The purpose of this review is to summarize recent developments linking disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms to an increased risk for obesity, and to review novel research on potential countermeasures. RECENT FINDINGS Effective treatments for obesity are limited, with long-term adherence to lifestyle changes proving difficult to maintain. Identifying new preventive strategies based on modifiable risk factors is therefore imperative in the fight against obesity. Disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms have an adverse impact on food choices, hunger and appetite, and have lifelong deleterious metabolic consequences when they occur during childhood and early adulthood. The upregulation of the endocannabinoid system and abnormalities in the temporal distribution of caloric intake were recently implicated in the link between sleep loss and obesity risk. In addition, alterations in circadian variation in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome have been identified as potential contributors to metabolic dysfunction during jet lag and shift work. Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment are thus new modifiable risk factors for obesity. Emerging evidence suggests that novel countermeasures, such as manipulations of the timing of food intake, may be effective strategies in the prevention of obesity. SUMMARY Four important findings are briefly reviewed: disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms in children and young adults are risk factors for the development of lifelong obesity; circadian misalignment, as occurs in shift work, has an adverse impact on energy balance and increases the risk of weight gain; the endocannabinoid system, an important regulator of hedonic feeding, could be a potential link between sleep, circadian rhythms, and feeding behavior; and disturbances of the circadian variation in composition of the gut microbiome may be involved in the increased risk of obesity associated with insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation is associated with increased risk of adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is uncertain whether sleep deprivation and/or altered sleep architecture affects glycemic regulation or insulin sensitivity or secretion. We hypothesized that in obese adolescents, sleep disturbances would associate with altered glucose and insulin homeostasis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study of 62 obese adolescents took place at the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Sleep Laboratory in a tertiary care children's hospital. Subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometric measurements, overnight polysomnography, and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and serial insulin and glucose levels were obtained, indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated, and sleep architecture was assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the association of total sleep and sleep stages with measures of insulin and glucose homeostasis, adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: We found significant U-shaped (quadratic) associations between sleep duration and both HbA(1c) and serial glucose levels on OGTT and positive associations between slow-wave sleep (N3) duration and insulin secretory measures, independent of degree of obesity, pubertal stage, sex, and obstructive sleep apnea measures. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient and excessive sleep was associated with short-term and long-term hyperglycemia in our obese adolescents. Decreased N3 was associated with decreased insulin secretion. These effects may be related, with reduced insulin secretory capacity leading to hyperglycemia. We speculate that optimizing sleep may stave off the development of T2DM in obese adolescents.},

abstract = {Experiments in animals suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin acts as an anorexigenic signal in the central nervous control of food intake. In humans, however, research has almost exclusively focused on the involvement of oxytocin in the regulation of social behavior. We investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on ingestion and metabolic function in healthy men. Food intake in the fasted state was examined 45 min after neuropeptide administration, followed by the assessment of olfaction and reward-driven snack intake in the absence of hunger. Energy expenditure was registered by indirect calorimetry, and blood was repeatedly sampled to determine concentrations of blood glucose and hormones. Oxytocin markedly reduced snack consumption, restraining, in particular, the intake of chocolate cookies by 25{\%}. Oxytocin, moreover, attenuated basal and postprandial levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and curbed the meal-related rise in plasma glucose. Energy expenditure and hunger-driven food intake as well as olfactory function were not affected. Our results indicate that oxytocin, beyond its role in social bonding, regulates nonhomeostatic, reward-related energy intake, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and the glucoregulatory response to food intake in humans. These effects can be assumed to converge with the psychosocial function of oxytocin and imply possible applications in the treatment of metabolic disorders.},

In this study, we measured CSF hypocretin-1 levels in various age ranges from infants to elder people to investigate the age-dependent change of hypocretin concentrations. DESIGN: CSF hypocretin levels were compared by age groups and gender. ANOVA was used to examine the influences of these two parameters on CSF hypocretin levels. SETTING: University-based sleep and biology laboratory. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy two patients were included in this study, with 157 males and 115 females (0-79 years old). INTERVENTIONS: CSF samples were obtained by lumber punctures with informed consents. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hypocretin-1 levels are not different in respect to gender or age, although our samples constitute a heterogeneous group with various disease conditions. CSF hypocretin-1 levels in infants under 4 months are similar to those in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Early maturation of hypocretin transmission is suggested. No age- or gender-dependent changes in CSF hypocretin is observed.},

We included studies if they were prospective with follow-up {\textgreater}3 years and had an assessment of sleep disturbances at baseline and incidence of type 2 diabetes. We recorded several characteristics for each study. We extracted quantity and quality of sleep, how they were assessed, and incident cases defined with different validated methods.

abstract = {Orexin (OX) neuropeptides stimulate feeding and arousal. Deficiency of orexin is implicated in narcolepsy, a disease associated with obesity, paradoxically in the face of reduced food intake. Here, we show that obesity in orexin-null mice is associated with impaired brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Failure of thermogenesis in OX-null mice is due to inability of brown preadipocytes to differentiate. The differentiation defect in OX-null neonates is circumvented by OX injections to OX-null dams. In vitro, OX, triggers the full differentiation program in mesenchymal progenitor stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts and brown preadipocytes via p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-1a (BMPR1A)-dependent Smad1/5 signaling. Our study suggests that obesity associated with OX depletion is linked to brown-fat hypoactivity, which leads to dampening of energy expenditure. Thus, orexin plays an integral role in adaptive thermogenesis and body weight regulation via effects on BAT differentiation and function. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Driven by the demands and opportunities of modern life, many people habitually sleep less than 6 h a night. In the sleep clinic, chronic sleep restriction is recognized by the diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome (ICSD-9, 307.49-4), which is receiving increased scrutiny as a potential risk to metabolic health. Its relevance for the practicing endocrinologist is highlighted by a stream of epidemiological data that show an association of insufficient sleep with increased incidence of obesity and related morbidities. A central theme of this update is the notion that sleep loss incurs additional metabolic cost, which triggers a set of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and behavioral adaptations aimed at increasing food intake and conserving energy. Although this coordinated response may have evolved to offset the metabolic demands of extended wakefulness in natural habitats with limited food availability, it can be maladaptive in the context of a modern environment that allows many to overeat while maintaining a sedentary lifestyle without sufficient sleep. Importantly, such sleep loss-related metabolic adaptation may undermine the success of behavioral interventions based on reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity to lower metabolic risk in obesity-prone individuals. This emerging perspective is based on data from recently published human interventional studies and requires further experimental support. Nevertheless, it now seems prudent to recommend that overweight and obese individuals attempting to reduce their caloric intake and maintain increased physical activity should obtain adequate sleep and, if needed, seek effective treatment for any coexisting sleep disorders.},

We compared the sleep-debt condition with measurements taken at the end of a sleep-recovery period when participants were allowed 12 h in bed per night for 6 nights. Findings. Glucose tolerance was lower in the sleep-debt condition than in the fully rested condition (p {\textless} 0.02), as were thyrotropin concentrations (p {\textless} 0.01). Evening cortisol concentrations were raised (p = 0.0001) and activity of the sympathetic nervous system was increased in the sleep-debt condition (p {\textless} 0.02). Interpretation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders are increasingly associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Whether the metabolic toll imposed by sleep-related disorders is caused by poor-quality sleep or due to other confounding factors is not known. The objective of this study was to examine whether experimental sleep fragmentation across all sleep stages would alter glucose metabolism, adrenocortical function, and sympathovagal balance. METHODS: Sleep was experimentally fragmented across all stages in 11 healthy, normal volunteers for two nights using auditory and mechanical stimuli. Primary outcomes included insulin sensitivity (S(I)), glucose effectiveness (S(G)), and insulin secretion, as determined by the intravenous glucose tolerance test. Secondary outcomes included measures of sympathovagal balance and serum levels of inflammatory markers, adipokines, and cortisol. RESULTS: Following two nights of sleep fragmentation, S(I) decreased from 5.02 to 3.76 (mU/L)(-1)min(-1) (P {\textless} .0001). S(G), which is the ability of glucose to mobilize itself independent of an insulin response, also decreased from 2.73 x 10(-2) min(-1) to 2.16 x 10(-2) min(-1) (P {\textless} .01). Sleep fragmentation led to an increase in morning cortisol levels and a shift in sympathovagal balance toward an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. Markers of systemic inflammation and serum adipokines were unchanged with sleep fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Fragmentation of sleep across all stages is associated with a decrease in S(I) and S(G). Increases in sympathetic nervous system and adrenocortical activity likely mediate the adverse metabolic effects of poor sleep quality.},
